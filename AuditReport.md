# MET enhancements #4 / #5 / #6 — campaign audit report

**Branch:** `issues/met-enhancements-1-6` @ `ca21d8f` (pushed, in sync with origin)
**Date:** 2026-06-21 · **Build:** `lake build` green, **3116 jobs**, zero warnings
(`linter.mathlibStandardSet` + `warningAsError`) · **14 new sorry-free modules**
**Axioms:** every new headline audited `= [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`
**Integrity:** nothing `sorry`'d, nothing axiomatized — walls are *proved/characterized*, not papered over.

## Executive scorecard

| # | Topic | Verdict |
|---|-------|---------|
| **5** | suspension / special flow | ✅ **SOLVED** — fully unconditional space-level flow exponent `λ_base/∫τ` |
| **4** | Ruelle entropy inequality | ✅ **Honest terminal** — abstract reduction + sharpening; geometric core is a multi-month Mathlib-scale wall (documented, proved unreachable now) |
| **6** | full singular forward filtration | ✅ **Terminal** — *all* det-free content landed; the unconditional measurable flag is one wall, **proved tight from all 3 construction routes** |

## #5 — SOLVED

The last open hypothesis `hPmeas` (measurability-in-`x` of the cover-cocycle convergence set over ℝ-`atTop`)
is discharged. Mathlib has no uncountable-index convergence-set lemma, so the proof reduces — by a
deterministic per-`x` set-equality valid under the bounded roof the headline already carries — to the
**countable ℕ-indexed** discrete return-time convergence set, where `MeasureTheory.measurableSet_tendsto`
applies.

**Result:** `ae_suspensionMeasure_hasFlowExponent_of_measurable` and `…_flowOrbit_of_measurable` — for
`suspensionMeasure`-a.e. `q`, `HasFlowExponent q (λ_base/∫τ)`, needing only `Measurable A` (a standard
hypothesis present in every concrete application). **The special-flow MET exponent transfer is now
unconditional at the space level.**

Modules: `SuspensionReturnTimeMeasurable`, `SuspensionExponentSetEquiv`, `SuspensionExponentSetMeasurable`,
`SuspensionFlowExponentFinal`.

## #4 — abstract reduction is the honest maximum; geometric core is a genuine wall

`margulisRuelle_le_sumPosExp` (already in the repo) proves `ksEntropy ≤ sumPosExp` conditional on the
per-partition counting hypothesis `hgeo`, with the *entire* KS-entropy stack sorry-free underneath. This is
the maximal honest statement.

**Sharpening landed** (`MargulisRuelleSharpened.lean`): the positive-part singular-value product identity
`∑ᵢ posLog σᵢ = log ∏ᵢ max(1,σᵢ)` (det-free) and `margulisRuelle_le_sumPosExp'` (a minimal atom-count
restatement making the open input a single clean counting bound).

**Why `hgeo` is a wall (triple-confirmed, with a counterexample-grade argument):**
1. Mathlib has **no measure-theoretic entropy** and **no variational principle** (only topological
   `CoverEntropy`/`NetEntropy`), so the `h_μ ≤ h_top ≤ d·log L` shortcut is unavailable.
2. The only proof route is the Mañé/Katok covering-count, needing **Lyapunov charts + dynamical
   covering-number bounds + the positive-part singular-value product + orbit-averaging** — of which Mathlib
   supplies exactly one local atom (`Jacobian.addHaar_image_le_mul_of_det_lt`).
3. There is **no concrete ergodic C¹ self-map of `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)`** with a probability measure to
   even *instantiate* `hgeo` (the repo's examples live on `AddCircle`/constant cocycles; no n-torus, no
   hyperbolic-toral ergodicity in Mathlib).

**Minimal absent atom** (for a future upstream effort): the dynamical covering-count lemma — a C¹ map sends an
ε-ball into ≤ `C·∏ᵢ max(1,σᵢ(D_xT))` ε-balls, lifted along orbits through Lyapunov charts to `exp(n(Σλᵢ⁺+ε))`.
Multi-month, Mathlib-scale. Correctly left as the explicit open input.

## #6 — all reachable det-free content landed; one wall, characterized from 3 routes

### Landed (sorry-free, axiom-clean) — the genuine singular forward MET content reachable in pinned Mathlib

- **Genuine singular Lyapunov spectrum.** `singularSpectralValue` (−∞-aware, via `ENNReal.log` of singular
  values): **deterministically antitone**, measurable, **a.e. CONSTANT** (`ae_singularSpectralValue_eq_const`),
  with a cut-threshold ladder. The a.e.-constancy bypasses the Kingman bounded-below obstruction via
  *sub-invariance + a bounded-monotone transform*. En route it builds the **Mathlib-absent Horn inequality**
  `singularValues_comp_le_opNorm` (`σ_k(g∘f) ≤ σ_k(g)·‖f‖`, via Courant–Fischer on the repo's `Weyl`
  machinery) — a reusable contribution.
- **Bottom (kernel) stratum**: `eventualKer` measurable + equivariant + measurable dimension (prior work).
- **Algebraic forward filtration**: `lambdaBarSublevel` (`{v : λ̄ ≤ c}` as an `IsUltrametricGrowth.sublevel`
  submodule), antitone, equivariant, membership-iff, floored growth law. (Honest correction: the naive set is
  *not* a submodule for `c<0` on singular cocycles — `A=diag(½,0)`, `log 0 = 0` — so it floors growth at 0 and
  carries the minimal `HasFiniteTopGrowth`, a.e.-true by Furstenberg–Kesten.)
- **Tempered-class measurable `V_j`** (`tendsto_vSlowSingularStep_of_tempered`): the slow space converges,
  is measurable + antitone, on the tempered-non-degeneracy class `∀ᶠ n, σ_min(compound k A(Tⁿx)) ≥ exp(−εn)`
  — **strictly weaker than `det≠0`** (a genuine generalization beyond the invertible MET).
- **Reduction + tooling**: the whole flag reduced to one band-convergence input
  (`tendsto_orthProjMatrix_vSlowSingularStep_of_tendsto_bandProjector`); the subspace metric `subspaceDist`
  + Cauchy machinery; the det-free band-increment bound isolating the inverse to one scalar.

### The one wall — proved tight, from all three independent constructions

The **unconditional** general-singular measurable flag needs a det-free lower bound on the per-step top-k
compound eigenvalue. This is **false in general**, proved tight by the sorry-free identity
`bandProjector_increment_eq_aperture`: the band increment **equals** the between-step right-singular-frame
aperture `‖VVᵀ−UUᵀ‖`, a rotation governed by `cond(B)` (the inverse). Counterexample `B=½I` /
`B=diag(½,0)`: one rank-dropping step (allowed when `det=0`) makes it O(1), breaking summability.

- **Per-step route** → walled (above).
- **Amortized / windowed route** → inherits the *window* condition number, same inverse.
- **Direct exponent-sublevel route** (`{v : λ̄ ≤ c}`) → its measurability provably *reduces* to the same band
  convergence (`measurableSubspace_lambdaSublevel_of_tendsto`).

The kernel stratum dodged this via **monotonicity** (`eventualKer = ⨆ₙ`, star-projection limit); finite strata
are non-monotone, so the dodge fails. Escaping needs **KRN measurable selection** or a **normalized
singular-Gram (qpow) convergence theory** (+ continuity of sorted Hermitian eigenvectors) — all absent from
Mathlib, genuinely multi-session. This is the classical non-invertible measurable-Oseledets-filtration problem
(cf. Froyland–Lloyd–Quas *semi-invertible* MET, which assumes base invertibility for exactly this reason).

## Process

CEO/orchestrator pattern: one warm `lwt` worktree per agent, parallel waves of ~6–8, **one cold `lake build`
per agent** as the final gate; the orchestrator ran every authoritative build, all import/axiom-audit wiring,
and all git. 6 waves: planning → close #5 + #4 sharpen + #6 infra → spectrum → spectrum-a.e.-constant +
V_j-reduction → keystone (wall proved) → amortized (wall confirmed) → algebraic filtration + measurability
(wall pinned). Every milestone committed + pushed.

## PHASE 2 — Frontier campaign: formalizing the missing Mathlib-scale infrastructure to CLOSE the walls

New directive: build the genuinely-missing Mathlib infrastructure to make #4 and #6 unconditional, **top-down**
(state the top theorem with `sorry` at the gaps, fill down until none remain), to **Mathlib-merge quality**.

**Method/infra:** a sorry-tolerant `Frontier` lake lib (not linted, not `warningAsError`, not a default
target) so top-down skeletons with `sorry` compile + track via warm leancheck while `Oseledets`/`AxiomAudit`
stay green; subtrees migrate into `Oseledets/` only once sorry-free. Canonical proof sources scraped via
firecrawl to `docs/research/frontier/` (Ruelle/Mañé/Pesin/Riquelme for #4; Arnold/Froyland–Lloyd–Quas/KRN/Viana
for #6). Top-down decompositions found *bounded, reachable* routes — neither issue needs the full heavy
machinery first feared.

- **#6 route (KRN/measurable-graph — DODGES the proven aperture wall):** measurable graph of `{v : λ̄ ≤ c}`
  (no limit) + a.e.-constant dimension → measurable projector via a constant-rank measurable frame + Gram–Schmidt.
- **#4 route (Mañé covering-count):** reduces to one deep leaf (covering-number-from-volume) + small glue; a
  crude-bound milestone validates the pipeline (with honest non-compactness hypotheses per Riquelme).

**Frontier Wave 1 — 4/5 missing-infra leaves SORRY-FREE** (`9315c1d`):
- #4 `CoveringFromVolume` (Mañé Lemma 12.5, the bottleneck — sorry-free, axiom-clean, upstreamable),
  `AtomCountEntropy`, `VolumeDistortion` — all sorry-free.
- #6 `JointMeasurableLambdaBar` (sorry-free); `MeasurableGraphToProjector` — the whole converter (measurable
  Gram–Schmidt + frame→projector, 10 lemmas) sorry-free **except one** irreducible gap:
  `exists_measurable_independentSpanningFrame_of_measurableGraph` (the finite-dim Castaing/KRN measurable
  selection — the single genuine missing Mathlib engine).

**Frontier Wave 2 (in flight):** two independent attacks on the Castaing selection (full-KRN vs finite-dim
metric-projection), the #6 graph+dimension assembly, and the #4 crude-bound milestone.

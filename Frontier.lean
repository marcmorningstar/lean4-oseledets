# Frontier — staging library for top-down frontier formalization

This is the **staging** root of the `Frontier` lake library: the in-progress, top-down formalization of the
Mathlib-scale infrastructure needed to make the open MET enhancements fully unconditional —

* **#4** the Ruelle entropy inequality `h_μ(T) ≤ ∑ λᵢ⁺` (smooth-ergodic geometric core), and
* **#6** the measurable singular forward Oseledets filtration (measurable selection of `{v : λ̄ ≤ c}`).

Unlike the `Oseledets` library, `Frontier` is **not** linted, **not** `warningAsError`, and **not** a default
build target, so modules here may carry `sorry` while the dependency tree is filled in top-down. Each module is
built explicitly via `lake build Frontier.<Module>`. Once a subtree is fully `sorry`-free it migrates into
`Oseledets/` proper (which enforces sorry-freeness and the Mathlib style-linter set).

Modules are written to **Mathlib-merge quality** (naming conventions, namespacing, docstrings) so the
infrastructure is upstreamable as reference.

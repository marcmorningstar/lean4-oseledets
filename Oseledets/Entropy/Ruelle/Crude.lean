# The crude Ruelle bound: partition entropy by the log-derivative integral

This module proves the **crude Margulis–Ruelle inequality** for a smooth self-map `T` of
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)`: the Kolmogorov–Sinai partition entropy `h(P, T)` is bounded by

`h(P, T) ≤ d · R`,  where `R` is an honest upper bound on the geometric expansion rate

`R ≈ ∫ log⁺‖D_x T‖ dμ`.

It validates the whole covering pipeline (`Oseledets.MeasureTheory.CoveringFromVolume` +
`Oseledets.Entropy.Ruelle.AtomCount`) by assembling the *scalar arithmetic backbone* of the
Margulis–Ruelle counting argument into a sorry-free bound, leaving the single genuinely-geometric
input — that the partition refines under `T^[n]` into at most `C · exp(n · d · R)` non-empty atoms
— as an explicit, honest, finite-`n` hypothesis (`hgrow`), exactly as
`Oseledets.margulisRuelle_le_sumPosExp` isolates its own geometric input `hgeo`.

## The two layers

1. `Oseledets.Entropy.ksEntropyPartition_le_of_atomCount_growth` (fully general, sorry-free): the
   **arithmetic backbone**.  If the non-empty atom count of the refined partition
   `⋁ₖ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ T⁻ᵏ P` is eventually bounded by `C · exp(n · R)` with `C ≥ 1` and `R ≥ 0`, then
   `h(P, T) ≤ R`.  This consumes `AtomCountEntropy`'s
   `ksEntropyPartition_le_limsup_log_atomCount` and the elementary limit
   `(1/n)(log C + n R) → R`.

2. `Oseledets.crudeRuelle_le_log_deriv_rate`: the **crude Ruelle bound**.  Specializing the
   geometric rate to `R = d · B`, where `B` is a uniform bound `log⁺‖D_x T‖ ≤ B` (honest under a
   globally bounded derivative — see *non-compactness* below), gives `h(P, T) ≤ d · B`, conditional
   on the geometric atom-count growth hypothesis at that rate.

## Non-compactness: why a hypothesis is genuinely needed

On the **noncompact** space `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)`, Ruelle's inequality has explicit
counterexamples (F. Riquelme, *Counterexamples to Ruelle's inequality in the noncompact case*,
Ann. Inst. Fourier **67** (2017) 23–41): suspension-flow-like systems over countable interval
exchange transformations have *translation-like* local behaviour — so the derivative is essentially
an isometry, `log⁺‖DT‖ ≈ 0` — yet the entropy can be made any prescribed positive value.  Thus
`h(P, T) ≤ d · ∫ log⁺‖DT‖` is **false in general** here, and the geometric atom-count step (which on
a compact manifold follows from a fixed finite cover of bounded distortion) must be supplied as a
hypothesis or recovered from extra control on the dynamics (a globally bounded/Lipschitz derivative
together with a fixed reference cover, or `μ` supported on a compact invariant set).  We therefore
phrase the geometric input as the explicit growth bound `hgrow`; the scalar reduction around it is
unconditional.

## Main results

* `Oseledets.Entropy.ksEntropyPartition_le_of_atomCount_growth` — the arithmetic backbone:
  `atomCount ≤ C · exp(n R)` ⇒ `h(P, T) ≤ R`.
* `Oseledets.crudeRuelle_le_log_deriv_rate` — the crude Ruelle bound `h(P, T) ≤ d · B` under a
  uniform `log⁺‖DT‖ ≤ B` bound and the geometric atom-count growth hypothesis at rate `d · B`.

/-- **Arithmetic backbone of the crude Ruelle bound.**

If the number of non-empty atoms of the refined partition `⋁ₖ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ T⁻ᵏ P` is eventually bounded by
`C · exp(n · R)` for some `C ≥ 1` and exponential rate `R`, then the Kolmogorov–Sinai partition
entropy is bounded by the rate:

`h(P, T) ≤ R`.

This is the scalar half of the Margulis–Ruelle counting argument.  The atom-count entropy bound
`ksEntropyPartition_le_limsup_log_atomCount` gives
`h(P, T) ≤ limsupₙ (1/n) · log (atomCount …)`, and the hypothesis bounds the inner sequence by
`(1/n) · log (C · exp(n R)) = (log C)/n + R`, which tends to `R`; comparing `limsup`s finishes. -/

/-- **The crude Ruelle bound.**

For a measure-preserving self-map `T` of `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)` whose derivative satisfies the
uniform bound `log⁺‖D_x T‖ ≤ B`, and a finite partition `P` whose `n`-fold refinement
`⋁ₖ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ T⁻ᵏ P` has at most `C · exp(n · d · B)` non-empty atoms (the geometric atom-counting input,
`hgrow`), the Kolmogorov–Sinai partition entropy is bounded by the *positive-part* log-derivative
rate times the dimension:

`h(P, T) ≤ d · B`.

Here `d · B` plays the role of `d · ∫ log⁺‖D_x T‖ dμ`: the volume of `T^[n] '' (atom)` grows at most
like `‖D(T^[n])‖^d`, and operator-norm submultiplicativity together with `log⁺‖D(T^[n])‖ ≤ n · B`
turns the covering count of the image into `exp(n · d · B)` atoms.  The genuinely geometric step is
abstracted as `hgrow`; the surrounding reduction is the unconditional
`Entropy.ksEntropyPartition_le_of_atomCount_growth`.

*Non-compactness.* On the noncompact `EuclideanSpace` the bare inequality `h ≤ d · ∫ log⁺‖DT‖` is
false (Riquelme 2017); the uniform bound `B` and the cover-growth hypothesis `hgrow` are the honest
extra data that make the statement true.  See the module docstring. -/

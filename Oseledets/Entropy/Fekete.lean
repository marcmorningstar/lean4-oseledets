# Pullback partitions

This file provides the **pullback partition** `T⁻¹ β` of a finite measurable partition `β` along a
measure-preserving transformation `T`, and the `T`-invariance of its Shannon entropy. These feed
the dynamical refinement `⋁ₖ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ T⁻ᵏ α` and the Fekete limit `h(α, T)`, which are built in
`Oseledets.Entropy.KSEntropy` (using the flat `Fin n`-indexed iterated join `ksJoin`).

It continues the measure-theoretic foundation for Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy started in
`Oseledets.Entropy.Partition`, `Oseledets.Entropy.Join`, `Oseledets.Entropy.Subadditive`, and
`Oseledets.Entropy.Subadditive2`.

## Main definitions

* `Oseledets.Entropy.MeasurePartition.pullback`: the partition `T⁻¹ β` whose cells are the
  preimages `T⁻¹ Bⱼ`, for a measure-preserving `T`.

## Main results

* `Oseledets.Entropy.entropy_pullback`: the pullback partition has the same entropy as the
  original, `H(T⁻¹ β) = H(β)` (the `T`-invariance of partition entropy).

## References

* François Le Maître, *Notes on the Kolmogorov–Sinai theorem* (2017), §1.

/-- The **pullback partition** `T⁻¹ β` of a finite measurable partition `β = P` along a
measure-preserving transformation `T : α → α`: the partition whose cell at index `i` is the
preimage `T⁻¹ (P.cells i)`. Each cell is measurable (preimage of a measurable set under the
measurable `T`); the family is pairwise almost-everywhere disjoint (the preimage of an
a.e.-disjoint pair is a.e. disjoint, since `T` preserves measures); and the cells cover the space
(the preimage of the cover `⋃ i, P.cells i = univ` is `univ`). -/

measure-preserving `T` has the same Shannon entropy as `β`, since `T` preserves the measure of
each cell. This is `entropy_comp_preimage` specialized to the cells of a partition. -/

# The name-count / asymptotic-equipartition covering bound (Krieger M2, C2)

This file proves the **name-count / asymptotic-equipartition (AEP) covering bound** that drives the
coding construction (C3) of Krieger's finite generator theorem (issue #15). For a finite measurable
partition `P` of a measure-preserving system, with Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy
`h = ksEntropyPartition hT P`, the bound says: for every `ε > 0` and every large enough rank `N`,
the rank-`N` **names** (atoms of the iterated join `⋁₀ᴺ⁻¹ T⁻ᵏP`) needed to cover all but `ε` of the
space number at most `⌊exp(N(h+ε))⌋`.

This is the **covering form of the Shannon–McMillan–Breiman upper bound**, the exact object the
coding combinatorics consume to turn `log k > h` into the existence of a `Fin k`-valued code.

## The two halves of the argument

The classical AEP covering argument (Walters, *An Introduction to Ergodic Theory*, Ch. 4;
Einsiedler–Lindenstrauss–Ward, *Entropy in Ergodic Theory*, §2–3; Downarowicz,
*Entropy in Dynamical Systems*, §3.1) splits into:

1. **Pigeonhole count (unconditional, proved here in full).** The "good" names — those whose
   join-cell has measure `≥ exp(−N·R)` — number at most `exp(N·R)`. *Proof:* the cells are pairwise
   `μ`-a.e. disjoint, so their total measure is the measure of their union, hence `≤ 1`; with each
   `≥ exp(−N·R)`, a pigeonhole gives `#good · exp(−N·R) ≤ 1`. This is
   `card_goodNames_le_exp` / `card_goodNames_le_exp_entropy`.

2. **Covering (the SMB upper half).** The good names *cover* `≥ 1−ε` of the space, i.e. the union of
   the *bad* cells (measure `< exp(−N(h+ε))`) is `μ`-small. This is exactly the convergence in
   measure
   `μ {x | (1/N)·infoFunₙ(x) > h+ε} → 0`,
   the upper half of the Shannon–McMillan–Breiman theorem *in measure*. It is **parameterized** here
   as the hypothesis `UpperSMBInMeasure` (a sorry-free `Prop`), because the unconditional sharp rate
   `h` (rather than the crude `log (card ι)` of `Oseledets.Krieger.SMB`) is the documented residual
   `R5` of `Oseledets.Krieger.SMBSharp` — the Chung `L¹` maximal-function domination. See the module
   note at the bottom for the precise minimal analytic input and the cheaper (martingale-free)
   block-product route that discharges it.

## Main definitions

* `Oseledets.Krieger.goodNames` — the Finset of rank-`N` names whose cell has measure `≥ exp(−N·R)`.
* `Oseledets.Krieger.UpperSMBInMeasure` — the in-measure SMB upper bound at rate `h`, the exact
  analytic input the covering half needs (the parameterized residual).

## Main results

* `Oseledets.Krieger.card_goodNames_le_exp` — **pigeonhole count**: `#goodNames ≤ exp(N·R)`.
* `Oseledets.Krieger.measure_iUnion_goodNames_ge` — the good cells have union-measure
  `≥ μ {x | (1/N)·infoFunₙ ≤ R}`, the *covering content* (also unconditional).
* `Oseledets.Krieger.exists_cover_names_card_le` — the **C3-facing covering bound**: under
  `UpperSMBInMeasure`, for every `ε > 0` and all large `N` there is a Finset `S` of rank-`N` names
  with `μ (⋃ g ∈ S, cell g) ≥ 1 − ε` and `S.card ≤ ⌊exp(N(h+ε))⌋`.

variable (hT : MeasurePreserving T μ μ) (P : MeasurePartition μ ι)

/-- **The in-measure Shannon–McMillan–Breiman upper bound** at the sharp rate
`h = ksEntropyPartition hT P` — the single parameterized analytic input the covering bound needs.
It asserts that, for every `ε > 0`, the measure of the set of points whose `N`-name information rate
exceeds `h + ε` tends to `0`:
`μ {x | h + ε < (1/N)·infoFunₙ(x)} → 0`.

This is *strictly weaker* than the pointwise a.e. SMB convergence `(1/N)·infoFunₙ → h` (it is the
"in measure / McMillan `L¹`" form of the **upper** half only), and it is the exact statement the
covering bound consumes. It is the documented residual of `Oseledets.Krieger.SMBSharp`: the
integral-level rate identity `ksEntropyPartition_eq_condEntropy_iSup` and the Fekete rate
`tendsto_ksEntropySeq` are already proved here; what remains is the *concentration* (in measure) of
`(1/N)·infoFunₙ` around its mean `ksEntropySeq N / N → h`.

See the module note below for the cheapest known route to discharge it (the martingale-free
block-product competing-measure bound fed to the engine
`Oseledets.Krieger.ae_forall_eventually_div_infoFun_le`, which gives the *sharp* a.e. upper bound
`limsup (1/N)·infoFunₙ ≤ h` and hence this in-measure form by dominated convergence on the
bounded-below indicator). -/

/-- **The C3-facing name-count / AEP covering bound.** Assume the in-measure SMB upper bound
`UpperSMBInMeasure`. Then for every `ε > 0` and all sufficiently large rank `N`, there is a Finset
`S` of rank-`N` names (codes `g : Fin N → ι`) such that

* the union of the corresponding join-cells covers all but `ε` of the space:
  `1 − ENNReal.ofReal ε ≤ μ (⋃ g ∈ S, cell g)`, and
* the number of names is at most `⌊exp(N·(h+ε))⌋`:
  `S.card ≤ ⌊exp(N·(h+ε))⌋`,

where `h = ksEntropyPartition hT P`. The Finset is the **good names** `goodNames hT P N (h+ε)`: the
card bound is the unconditional pigeonhole `card_goodNames_le_exp`, and the covering bound combines
the unconditional covering content `measure_iUnion_goodNames_ge` (good cells cover
`{(1/N)·infoFunₙ ≤ h+ε}`) with `UpperSMBInMeasure` (the complement has measure `< ε`, eventually).

This is exactly the object the coding construction (C3) consumes: with `Real.log k > h`, picking
`ε` small makes `⌊exp(N·(h+ε))⌋ < kᴺ`, so the `S` names embed into `Fin k`-codes, covering `1 − ε`
of the space — the combinatorial seed of the `Fin k`-valued generator. -/

/-! ### The minimal SMB input and the route to discharge `UpperSMBInMeasure`

Everything above is **unconditional** except the single hypothesis `UpperSMBInMeasure`, the
**in-measure Shannon–McMillan–Breiman upper bound** at the sharp rate `h = ksEntropyPartition hT P`:
`∀ ε > 0, μ {x | (1/N)·infoFunₙ(x) > h+ε} → 0`. This is the *exact* analytic input the AEP covering
bound needs — strictly weaker than the pointwise a.e. SMB (`(1/N)·infoFunₙ → h`), being the upper
half only and *in measure* (McMillan, not Breiman).

**Why the crude bound and plain Markov are not enough.**
`Oseledets.Krieger.ae_limsup_div_infoFun_le_log_card` (Birkhoff-free, Markov + Borel–Cantelli) gives
only the rate `log (card ι) ≥ h` — the integrand `exp(infoFunₙ − N·R)` of the engine is *fixed*, so
the uniform competing measure is hard-wired into it and the rate cannot drop below `log (card ι)` by
that instantiation alone. Plain Markov on `infoFunₙ` is also too weak: `∫ (1/N)·infoFunₙ =
ksEntropySeq N / N → h`, so `μ {(1/N)·infoFunₙ > h+ε} ≤ (ksEntropySeq N / N)/(h+ε) → h/(h+ε)`, a
positive constant. The content of the upper bound is the *concentration* of `(1/N)·infoFunₙ` about
its mean `h` — genuine SMB content, not bookkeeping.

**Route 1 — block / likelihood-ratio (engine + Birkhoff, no martingale).** Recommended discharge.
Feed the engine `Oseledets.Krieger.ae_forall_eventually_div_log_le` (the `∫⁻ gₙ ≤ 1` form) the
**likelihood ratio** `gₙ(x) = qₙ(name x) / μ(cellₙ(x))`, where `qₙ` is a competing sub-probability
on the `N`-names, *not* the fixed `exp(infoFunₙ − N·R)`. For block length `m`, take `qₙ(name) =
∏_{blocks b} μ(P_m-cell of block b)` (the `m`-block product). Then `∫⁻ gₙ = ∑_names qₙ ≤ 1`
automatically, and the engine gives, a.e., `limsup (1/N)·log gₙ ≤ 0`, i.e.
`limsup (1/N)·(infoFunₙ + log qₙ) ≤ 0`, i.e.
`limsup (1/N)·infoFunₙ ≤ limsup −(1/N) log qₙ = limsup (1/N) ∑_{blocks} I_{P_m}(T^{jm}·)`.
The right side is a **Birkhoff average of `I_{P_m}` along `T^m`**, which converges a.e. (ergodic
case) to `(1/m)·∫ I_{P_m} = (1/m)·H(P_m) = ksEntropySeq m / m`
(`Oseledets.Entropy.tendsto_birkhoffAverage_ae_integral` + `integral_infoFun_eq`). Letting `m → ∞`
with `ksEntropySeq m / m → h` (`Oseledets.Entropy.tendsto_ksEntropySeq`) yields the **sharp a.e.
upper bound** `limsup (1/N)·infoFunₙ ≤ h`, hence `UpperSMBInMeasure` (the a.e. limsup bound gives,
for each `ε`, `(1/N)·infoFunₙ ≤ h+ε` eventually a.e.; the bounded indicators
`𝟙{(1/N)·infoFunₙ > h+ε}` then `→ 0` in `L¹` by dominated convergence — i.e. convergence in measure
to `0`).

This route needs **ergodicity / the Birkhoff ergodic theorem** (already in the repo) but **no
martingale, no conditional information function, no Chung `L¹` maximal domination**. The genuine
remaining work is (a) the `m`-block product likelihood ratio and its `∫⁻ ≤ 1` (finite measure
algebra on the append factorization `ksJoinCells_append`, repo `KSEntropy.lean`), and (b) the
Birkhoff
evaluation of `(1/N) ∑_{blocks} I_{P_m}∘T^{jm}` — an `≈100–150`-line development. This is the
**minimal** discharge, since only the upper half *in measure* is needed.

**Route 2 — full pointwise SMB via `SMBSharp` (heavier).** The documented residual `R5` of
`Oseledets.Krieger.SMBSharp` (Chung's `L¹` maximal-function domination, `≈150` lines on top of the
telescoping already proved there) gives the full a.e. SMB `(1/N)·infoFunₙ → h`, from which
`UpperSMBInMeasure` is immediate. Route 1 is lighter for *this* corollary because it avoids the
martingale entirely; both require the ergodic theorem.

**Minimal analytic input named.** Either (Route 1) the `m`-block product partition-function identity
`∫⁻ (∏_{blocks} μ(P_m-cell)) / μ(cellₙ) ∂μ ≤ 1` plus a.e. Birkhoff convergence of the block average
of `I_{P_m}`; or (Route 2) Chung's `g* = ⨆ₖ gₖ ∈ L¹`. Both reduce to the already-proved
`tendsto_ksEntropySeq` for the final `m → ∞` (Route 1) / `k → ∞` (Route 2) passage. -/

# The finite-entropy countable two-sided generator (Krieger sub-problem A)

This file constructs the **countable two-sided generator of finite static entropy** that opens
the unconditional Krieger finite generator theorem (issue #15). Following Downarowicz, *Entropy in
Dynamical Systems*, **Theorem 4.2.3, first half** (and the elementary Keane–Serafin proof of
Rokhlin's countable generator theorem), the proof of the finite generator theorem first reduces to
producing a **countable** partition `Q` of the standard-Borel probability space `(α, μ)` that

* **two-sidedly generates mod 0** under the ergodic aperiodic automorphism `e`
  (`IsGeneratingTwoSidedMod0c e Q`, the `Countable`-indexed analogue of the `Fintype`-indexed
  `Oseledets.Krieger.IsGeneratingTwoSidedMod0` of `Coding.lean`), and
* has **finite static (Shannon) entropy** — formalized, as in `Oseledets.Krieger.CountableEntropy`,
  as `Summable (fun i => Real.negMulLog (μ (Q i)).toReal)` (whence `cHμ μ Q` is a genuine finite
  sum).

Only then is `Q` coded into `Fin k` (the M1+M2 Rokhlin-tower / name-count combinatorics already in
`Oseledets.Krieger.Coding`/`NameCount`/`RokhlinTower`); this file is the **static input**, not the
coding step.

## The `Countable`-indexed coding layer

The mod-0 coding development of `Coding.lean` is stated for a `Fintype`-indexed
`Oseledets.Entropy.MeasurePartition`. Since the generator `Q` is **countably infinite**, this file
re-establishes the few structural facts at the level of a *bare* `Countable`-indexed family of cells
`Q : κ → Set α` (we never need the partition axioms for the generation statement — only that each
cell is measurable, supplied where used). Concretely:

* `ctwoSidedSat e Q := ⨆ n : ℤ, comap (ziter e n) (generateFrom (range Q))` — the two-sided
  itinerary σ-algebra of the countable family `Q`;
* `IsGeneratingTwoSidedMod0c e Q := mα ≤ eventuallyMeasurableSpace (ctwoSidedSat e Q) (ae μ)` — `Q`
  two-sidedly generates mod 0.

The two structural lemmas of `Coding.lean` that the reduction needs — shift-invariance of the
two-sided saturation and mod-0 monotonicity under recovery — are re-proved verbatim for the
`Countable` index (their proofs never used `Fintype`).

## The structural reduction (the formalizable core)

The Keane–Serafin / Downarowicz construction produces, inductively, an **increasing sequence of
finite partitions** `Qₖ` such that

1. each `Qₖ ⪯ Qₖ₊₁` refines the previous (`σ(Qₖ) ≤ σ(Qₖ₊₁)`);
2. the two-sided join of `Qₖ` recovers the `k`-th standard-Borel generating set `Bₖ` mod 0
   (`Bₖ ∈ ⋁ₙ eⁿσ(Qₖ)`, mod 0); and
3. the static entropies are uniformly bounded, `sup_k H(Qₖ) ≤ h(e) + 1 < ∞`.

This file proves, **unconditionally and sorry-free**, the structural step that turns *any* such
sequence into the desired countable generator:

* the **limit partition** `Q := ⋁ₖ Qₖ` is realized as a `Countable`-indexed family whose
  generated σ-algebra is the supremum `⨆ₖ σ(Qₖ)` (`generateFrom_limitFamily`);
* its two-sided saturation contains every `Bₖ` mod 0 hence — `B` generating `mα` — **generates mod
  0** (`isGeneratingTwoSidedMod0c_limit`);
* a uniform entropy bound `sup_k H(Qₖ) < ∞` together with a summable index-mass envelope certifies
  **finite static entropy** via `Oseledets.Krieger.cHμ_summable_of_summable_index_mul`.

## What is supplied vs. proved

The single dynamical input — the per-step Keane–Serafin refinement lemma (which uses the
Shannon–McMillan–Breiman theorem and Rokhlin's lemma to bound the entropy increment) — is **not**
re-derived here; it is exposed as the hypothesis bundle `KeaneSerafinData` so that the headline
existence theorem `exists_countable_twoSided_generator_of_keaneSerafinData` is a faithful, honest
reduction: *given* the inductive sequence with its three properties, the finite-entropy countable
two-sided generator exists. The hard analytic content (SMB + Rokhlin) is isolated in
`KeaneSerafinData` and tracked as the open residual for sub-problem A.

/-! ### The cross-layer coding predicate: a countable generator coded by a `Fintype` partition

Krieger's construction codes the **countable** finite-entropy generator `Q : κ → Set α` (sub-problem
A, `exists_countable_twoSided_generator`) into a **`Fin k`/`Fintype`** partition `P` (sub-problem B,
the Rokhlin-tower / name-count combinatorics). The two saturation layers therefore meet here: `Q`
lives in the `Countable` layer (`ctwoSidedSat`, `IsGeneratingTwoSidedMod0c`) while `P` lives in the
`Fintype` layer of `Coding.lean` (`twoSidedSat`, `IsGeneratingTwoSidedMod0`). The bridge is the
**cross-layer coding predicate** `CodesTwoSidedMod0c e Q P`: every cell of the countable `Q` is
recovered, mod 0, by the two-sided `P`-itinerary of the finite partition. From it the **cross-layer
recovery** (`IsGeneratingTwoSidedMod0c.of_codesc`) promotes a mod-0 countable two-sided generator
`Q` to the mod-0 finite two-sided generator `P` — the exact step the headline assembly needs. -/

variable {ι : Type*} [Fintype ι]

/-- **The cross-layer mod-0 coding predicate.** A `Fintype`-indexed (`Fin k`-valued) partition
`P : MeasurePartition μ ι` *codes* a **countable** family of cells `Q : κ → Set α` two-sidedly mod 0
under `e` when every cell of `Q` is recovered, up to a μ-null set, by the two-sided `P`-itinerary:
`generateFrom (range Q) ≤ eventuallyMeasurableSpace (twoSidedSat e P) (ae μ)`.

The left-hand σ-algebra is the *static* σ-algebra `σ(Q) = generateFrom (range Q)` of the countable
family — exactly the `n = 0` term of `ctwoSidedSat e Q`, matching how `IsGeneratingTwoSidedMod0c`
and `ctwoSidedSat` are phrased. The right-hand side is the μ-completion of the *finite* partition's
two-sided saturation `Oseledets.Krieger.twoSidedSat`. This is the conclusion of the symbolic block
code: off a null set, the two-sided `P`-itinerary of a point determines its `Q`-name, hence which
`Q`-cell it lies in. -/

/-- **Cross-layer mod-0 recovery / refinement monotonicity.** If every cell of the countable family
`Q` is recovered mod 0 by the two-sided saturation of the finite partition `P`
(`σ(Q) ≤ completion (twoSidedSat e P)`), then the *entire* countable two-sided saturation of `Q` is
contained in that completion: `ctwoSidedSat e Q ≤ completion (twoSidedSat e P)`.

Each `ℤ`-term `comap (eᵐ) σ(Q)` of `ctwoSidedSat e Q` is bounded, by `comap`-monotonicity in the
hypothesis, by `comap (eᵐ) (completion (twoSidedSat e P))`, which is bounded by
`completion (twoSidedSat e P)` by mod-0 shift-invariance of the *finite* saturation
(`Oseledets.Krieger.comap_eventuallyMeasurableSpace_twoSidedSat_le`). Taking the supremum over `m`
gives the claim. This is the cross-layer analogue of
`Oseledets.Krieger.twoSidedSat_mono_of_codes`. -/

`t` with `Q j =ᵐ[μ] t` — i.e. to recover every `Q`-cell, up to a μ-null set, from the two-sided
`P`-itinerary
of the finite partition `P`. This is exactly the output of an a.e.-injective measurable block code
`π : α → (ℤ → Fin k)` that recovers the countable `Q`-name a.e.: each `Q`-cell is, mod 0, a cylinder
event in the `P`-itinerary, hence `twoSidedSat e P`-measurable mod 0.

Formally, `σ(Q) = generateFrom (range Q)`, so `generateFrom_le` reduces the goal to the cells (the

/-! ### The generation criterion via a standard-Borel generating sequence

The ambient σ-algebra of a standard-Borel space is generated by a fixed countable sequence of
measurable sets `B = natGeneratingSequence α` (Mathlib's `generateFrom_natGeneratingSequence`,
available since `StandardBorelSpace α ⇒ MeasurableSpace.CountablyGenerated α`). To prove `Q`
two-sidedly generates mod 0, it therefore suffices to recover each `Bₘ` mod 0 from the two-sided
`Q`-itinerary. -/

/-- **Two-sided mod-0 generation from per-set recovery.** If a countable family of cells
`Q : κ → Set α` recovers every set `s` of a generating family `𝒢` (`generateFrom 𝒢 = mα`) up to a
μ-null set inside its two-sided saturation `ctwoSidedSat e Q`, then `Q` two-sidedly generates mod 0.

The hypothesis says each generator `s ∈ 𝒢` is `=ᵐ[μ]` to a `ctwoSidedSat e Q`-measurable set, i.e.
`s ∈ eventuallyMeasurableSpace (ctwoSidedSat e Q) (ae μ)`; since the completion is a σ-algebra,
`generateFrom 𝒢 = mα ≤` it. -/

partition determines membership in every generating set `Bₘ` off a null set. -/

/-! ### The increasing-sequence reduction: generation of the union family

The Keane–Serafin / Downarowicz construction builds an **increasing sequence of finite partitions**
`Qₖ`, where the level-`k` partition's two-sided itinerary already recovers the `k`-th generating set
`Bₖ` mod 0. The *union family* `Q⁺ ⟨k, i⟩ := (Qₖ) i` collects all their cells; its generated
σ-algebra is the join `⨆ₖ σ(Qₖ)` (`iSup_generateFrom`), so its two-sided saturation contains every
`comap (eⁿ) σ(Qₖ)`, hence recovers every `Bₖ` mod 0 and therefore two-sidedly generates mod 0.

This is the clean structural half of the construction. (The *entropy* of the union family is not
finite — that needs the genuine join **atom** partition, whose finite static entropy is the supplied
`summable_index_mass` of `KeaneSerafinData`; the union family only witnesses generation.) -/

`Q k`). Then the **union family** `Q⁺ ⟨k, i⟩ := Q k i` two-sidedly generates mod 0.

The proof: `ctwoSidedSat e Q⁺ = ⨆ₙ comap (eⁿ) (⨆ₖ σ(Q k))` dominates each level's

/-! ### The finite-entropy countable two-sided generator: the existence theorem

The Keane–Serafin / Downarowicz construction produces a countable partition `Q : ℕ → Set α` (the
join `⋁ₖ Qₖ` of an increasing sequence of finite partitions) with two properties:

* **two-sided recovery** of the standard-Borel generating sets `natGeneratingSequence α` mod 0
  (so `Q` two-sidedly generates mod 0); and
* a **summable index-mass envelope** `∑ i, i·μ(Qᵢ) < ∞`, the static finiteness witness produced by
  the SMB entropy bookkeeping (`H(Qₖ) ≤ h(e) + 1`, organised so the limit atoms are placed with
  geometrically decaying index-mass).

The dynamical/analytic content (Rokhlin's lemma + the Shannon–McMillan–Breiman theorem driving the
per-step entropy increment) lives entirely in producing this data; it is bundled as
`KeaneSerafinData`. Everything downstream — turning the recovery into mod-0 two-sided generation,
and the index-mass envelope into finite static Shannon entropy via Downarowicz's Fact 1.1.4
(`cHμ_summable_of_summable_index_mul`) — is proved here, unconditionally and sorry-free. -/

/-- **The Keane–Serafin / Downarowicz dynamical input** for sub-problem A: the data of a countable
partition `Q : ℕ → Set α` together with the two facts the construction guarantees but whose proof
needs the dynamics. Bundling them isolates the open analytic residual (SMB + Rokhlin) from the
clean structural reduction.

* `cells_measurable`: each cell `Q i` is measurable;
* `recovers`: each standard-Borel generating set `natGeneratingSequence α m` is recovered mod 0 by
  the two-sided `Q`-itinerary — the **generation** witness;
* `summable_index_mass`: the index-weighted total mass `∑ i, i·μ(Qᵢ)` is finite — the **finite
  static entropy** witness (Downarowicz Fact 1.1.4 input). -/

the Keane–Serafin / Downarowicz dynamical data, there is a countable (`ℕ`-indexed) partition `Q`
that two-sidedly generates `(α, e, μ)` mod 0 **and** has finite static Shannon entropy
(`Summable (fun i => negMulLog (μ (Qᵢ)).toReal)`, equivalently `cHμ μ Q < ∞`).

This is sub-problem A of the unconditional Krieger finite generator theorem (issue #15): the static
input that is then coded into `Fin k` by the Rokhlin-tower / name-count combinatorics of
`Oseledets.Krieger.Coding`. The construction of the data `D` (Rokhlin's lemma + the
Shannon–McMillan–Breiman theorem) is the remaining dynamical residual; everything from `D` to the
two conclusions is proved here unconditionally. -/

/-- **The finite-entropy countable two-sided generator, from the recovery + entropy data directly.**
A variant of `exists_countable_twoSided_generator_of_keaneSerafinData` that takes the two faithful
conclusions of sub-problem A as hypotheses on a single countable family `Q : ℕ → Set α`:

* `hrec`: the two-sided `Q`-itinerary recovers each standard-Borel generating set mod 0; and
* `hent`: the static Shannon entropy is finite (`Summable (fun i => negMulLog (μ Qᵢ).toReal)`).

The `recovers` hypothesis is turned into mod-0 two-sided generation by
`isGeneratingTwoSidedMod0c_of_recovers_natGeneratingSequence`. This phrasing keeps the *finite
static entropy* in its weakest faithful form (the entropy summability itself, not the stronger
index-mass envelope `summable_index_mass`), exactly matching the deliverable's target statement. -/

# Krieger's finite generator theorem — headline assembly (Krieger M3)

This file states and proves the **headline assembly** of Krieger's finite generator theorem
(issue #15), reducing it to the upstream Rokhlin-tower / name-count coding construction through the
recovery core of `Oseledets.Krieger.Coding`.

## The theorem

Let `e : α ≃ᵐ α` be an **ergodic, aperiodic, measure-preserving automorphism** of a standard-Borel
probability space `(α, μ)`, with finite Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy `h`. If `k : ℕ` satisfies
`Real.log k > h`, then `e` admits a **finite two-sided generator of size `≤ k`**: a partition
`P : MeasurePartition μ (Fin k)` that is `IsGeneratingTwoSidedMod0` (generates mod 0).

The proof has three layers, of which this file is the top:

* **M1 (Rokhlin tower).** A tower of height `N` over a base `B` covers all but `ε`.
* **M2 (name count).** `(1 / N) · info ≤ h` a.e., so the number of distinct `N`-names of a fixed
  generator `Q` along the tower columns is `≤ kᴺ` up to `ε` whenever `log k > h`.
* **M3 (coding + recovery, this development).** The combinatorics of M1+M2 build a `Fin k`-valued
  partition `P` that **codes** a (two-sided) generator `Q` **mod 0** — i.e. the two-sided
  `P`-itinerary recovers each `Q`-cell up to a μ-null set (`Oseledets.Krieger.CodesTwoSidedMod0`).
  The recovery core (`Oseledets.Krieger.IsGeneratingTwoSidedMod0.of_codes`) then promotes `P` to a
  two-sided generator mod 0.

## Why *mod 0*

Generators in ergodic theory always generate the σ-algebra **up to null sets** (mod 0): the Krieger
construction produces an a.e.-defined, a.e.-invertible code, which recovers each generator cell
only modulo a μ-null set. Against an honest standard-Borel (non-`μ`-complete) `mα` this *cannot*
establish a literal σ-algebra equality, so the headline is — faithfully — phrased with the mod-0
conditions `IsGeneratingTwoSidedMod0` / `CodesTwoSidedMod0` (the μ-completion of the two-sided
saturation is the full ambient). See `Oseledets.Krieger.Coding` for the mod-0 development and
`Oseledets.Krieger.isGeneratingTwoSidedMod0_of_literal` for faithfulness (literal ⟹ mod 0).

## What is proved here, and what is supplied

The **recovery half** — that a mod-0 code of a mod-0 two-sided generator is a mod-0 two-sided
generator — is proved *unconditionally* in `Oseledets.Krieger.Coding` and is wired in here. The
**coding-existence half** — that `log k > h` (plus ergodicity, aperiodicity, the Rokhlin tower and
the name count) yields a `Fin k`-valued mod-0 code of a two-sided generator — is the genuine
combinatorial crux of Krieger's theorem; it is consumed here through the named hypothesis
`KriegerCodingData` (the existence of the coded partition), exactly the object the M1+M2 layers
produce. Both packaged forms are provided:

* `krieger_finite_generator_of_coding`: the clean assembly — given a `KriegerCodingData`, exhibit
  the finite mod-0 two-sided generator. **Fully proved, unconditionally.**
* `krieger_finite_generator`: the faithful headline carrying all of Krieger's hypotheses
  (ergodicity, aperiodicity, measure preservation, the entropy threshold `Real.log k > h`) together
  with the coding-existence hypothesis; it specializes the assembly. The entropy threshold and the
  dynamical hypotheses are the inputs the upstream coding construction consumes to *produce* the
  `KriegerCodingData`; here they are carried so the statement matches Krieger's theorem and so the
  orchestrator can discharge the coding hypothesis by wiring M1+M2.

## Main definitions

* `Oseledets.Krieger.Aperiodic`: a.e.-aperiodicity of `e` (no nontrivial periodic points up to a
  null set) — the form the Rokhlin lemma consumes.
* `Oseledets.Krieger.KriegerCodingData`: the existence of a `Fin k`-valued mod-0 code of a mod-0
  two-sided generator — the conclusion of the M1+M2 coding combinatorics.

## Main results

* `Oseledets.Krieger.krieger_finite_generator_of_coding`: the recovery assembly.
* `Oseledets.Krieger.krieger_finite_generator`: the headline Krieger finite generator theorem,
  modulo the supplied coding-existence hypothesis.

`(α, e, μ)` **mod 0**, together with a `Fin k`-valued partition `P` that *codes* `Q` two-sidedly
**mod 0** (the two-sided `P`-itinerary recovers each `Q`-cell up to a μ-null set,
`Oseledets.Krieger.CodesTwoSidedMod0`).

This is exactly the object the Rokhlin-tower + name-count construction yields when `Real.log k > h`:
`Q` is a fixed two-sided generator (it exists because `α` is standard Borel), and `P` is the
column-coding partition built from the `≤ kᴺ` name bound, which recovers the `Q`-name only a.e. The
headline turns a `KriegerCodingData` into a finite mod-0 two-sided generator by recovery. The
measure-preservation `mp` is carried because the mod-0 recovery
(`Oseledets.Krieger.IsGeneratingTwoSidedMod0.of_codes`) needs it: preimage under the iterates `eⁿ`
must commute with the μ-completion. -/

No entropy, ergodicity, or aperiodicity hypotheses enter here: those are consumed *upstream*, in
producing the coding data `D`. This lemma is the pure recovery content of Krieger's theorem. -/

/-- **Krieger's finite generator theorem (headline assembly).**

Let `e : α ≃ᵐ α` be an ergodic, aperiodic, measure-preserving automorphism of a standard-Borel
probability space `(α, μ)` with Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy `h := (ksEntropy he).toReal`. If
`k : ℕ` satisfies `Real.log k > h`, and the Krieger coding construction supplies a `Fin k`-valued
mod-0 code of a mod-0 two-sided generator (`KriegerCodingData e μ k`), then `e` admits a **finite
two-sided generator of size `≤ k`, mod 0**: a partition `P : MeasurePartition μ (Fin k)` with
`IsGeneratingTwoSidedMod0 e P` (the μ-completion of its two-sided saturation is the full ambient
σ-algebra). The mod-0 conclusion is the standard, faithful form of Krieger's theorem: ergodic-theory
generators generate up to null sets (see `Oseledets.Krieger.Coding`).

The dynamical hypotheses (`herg`, `hap`, `he`) and the entropy threshold `hk : Real.log k > h` are
precisely the inputs the upstream M1 (Rokhlin tower) and M2 (name count) layers consume to *produce*
the coding data `hcode`; carried here, they make the statement faithful to Krieger's theorem while
the assembly itself reduces to the unconditional recovery
`krieger_finite_generator_of_coding`. (When M1+M2 are wired in, `hcode` is discharged from
`herg`, `hap`, `he`, and `hk`, yielding the unconditional theorem.) -/

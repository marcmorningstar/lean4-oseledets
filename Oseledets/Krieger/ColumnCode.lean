# The measurable bi-infinite sentinel parser for Krieger's symbolic code (C3, sub-problem B)

This file builds the **single largest infrastructure gap** that the column-code residual of
sub-problem B (C3) of Krieger's finite generator theorem (issue #15) was reduced to in
`Oseledets.Krieger.Recovery`: the **measurable bi-infinite sentinel parser**

`D : (ℤ → Fin k) → κ`

that locates the marker/sentinel structure of a `ℤ`-indexed code stream around coordinate `0`,
extracts the local block, and decodes it — *as a measurable function of the stream*. The module note
at the bottom of `Recovery.lean` flagged this — point (3) — as the part with **no Mathlib analogue**
and the "genuine multi-week residual". **This file discharges it, unconditionally and sorry-free.**

## The verdict: the measurable bi-infinite parser is constructible on current Mathlib

The construction needs **no new symbolic-dynamics infrastructure** — only three standard pieces of
Mathlib measurability, assembled:

* `measurable_pi_apply` — each coordinate projection `w ↦ w n` of the product space `ℤ → Fin k` is
  measurable;
* `measurable_find` (`Nat.find` of a totalized forward search is measurable) — gives a **measurable
  sentinel-position function** in each direction (the backward search is a forward search in the
  reflected stream); and
* `measurable_to_countable'` — the codomain `κ` is `Countable` with `MeasurableSingletonClass`, so
  the parser is measurable as soon as each preimage `D⁻¹{j}` is measurable.

The preimage `D⁻¹{j}` decomposes as a **countable union over block shapes** `(b, L, l)` (start
`b : ℤ`, length `L : ℕ`, content `l : List (Fin k)`) of cylinder sets
`{blockStart = b} ∩ {blockLen = L} ∩ {window b L = l}` — each measurable. The window-content
cylinder `{w | window w b L = l}` is a **finite intersection of coordinate-singleton constraints**
(`measurableSet_window_eq`). This is the whole of the "measurable bi-infinite parse".

So the residual flagged as multi-week is, in fact, a few hundred lines of routine measurability.
What genuinely remains for an *unconditional* `ColumnCodeData` is the **dynamical** content — the
construction of one fixed code symbol `c : α → Fin k` whose per-column blocks spell the sentinel
encodings of the `Q`-names, and the a.e. recovery that the parser then reads off (points (1), (2),
(4) of the `Recovery` note). That genuinely-dynamical core is isolated, sorry-free, in the sharpened
`SentinelColumnCode` bundle below — strictly sharper than `ColumnCodeData` because the parser `D` is
no longer a hypothesis: it is **constructed and proved measurable here**, and the bundle only has to
supply the code symbol and the a.e. *correctness* of the parse.

## Main definitions

* `window w b L` — the length-`L` block of the stream `w` starting at integer coordinate `b`.
* `fwdSentinel s b w` / `bwdSentinel s b w` — the forward / backward distance to the nearest
  sentinel `s` from anchor `b` (totalized: `0` if the search direction has no sentinel).
* `blockStart s w` / `blockLen s w` / `blockContent s w` — the start, length and `List (Fin k)`
  content of the sentinel block containing coordinate `0`.
* `sentinelParse s dec w` — the parser: decode `blockContent s w` via `dec : List (Fin k) → κ`.

## Main results (all sorry-free)

* `measurableSet_window_eq` — `{w | window w b L = l}` is measurable.
* `measurable_fwdSentinel`, `measurable_bwdSentinel` — the sentinel-distance functions are
  measurable; hence the block-boundary level sets `measurableSet_blockStart_eq`,
  `measurableSet_blockLen_eq`.
* `measurableSet_blockContent_decode_eq` — each preimage `{w | dec (blockContent s w) = j}` is
  measurable (the countable-block-shape decomposition).
* `measurable_sentinelParse` — **the headline: the bi-infinite sentinel parser is measurable.**
* `SentinelColumnCode.toColumnCodeData` — a sharpened residual bundle (code symbol + a.e. parse
  correctness) yields a full `Oseledets.Krieger.ColumnCodeData`, hence (via `ColumnCodeData.codes`)
  the cross-layer mod-0 code.

/-! ### Coordinate cylinders of the bi-infinite stream

The product space `ℤ → Fin k` carries the product σ-algebra; each coordinate projection
`w ↦ w c` is measurable (`measurable_pi_apply`), so the singleton-value cylinder `{w | w c = s}` is
measurable. This is the only atom every measurability proof in this file is built from. -/

/-- **The single-coordinate cylinder is measurable.** `{w | w c = s}` is the preimage of the
singleton `{s}` under the measurable coordinate projection `w ↦ w c` (`measurable_pi_apply`). Every
measurability statement below — the window cylinders, the sentinel-position level sets, the parser
preimages — is assembled from this atom by countable Boolean operations. -/

/-! ### The window extractor and the window cylinder

`window w b L` reads the length-`L` block of the stream starting at integer coordinate `b`. The
parser will read off the content of the sentinel block containing coordinate `0` through this map.
Its key measurability fact, `measurableSet_window_eq`, is that fixing the start `b`, length `L`, and
target content `l` carves out a measurable cylinder — a *finite* intersection of coordinate
constraints. -/

`[w b, w (b+1), …, w (b+L-1)] : List (Fin k)`. A decoder reads off the sentinel block containing
coordinate `0` as `window w (blockStart …) (blockLen …)`. -/

content-extraction half of the parser; combined with measurable block boundaries it gives the parser
preimage decomposition. -/

/-! ### The measurable sentinel-position search

The block boundaries are located by searching for the nearest sentinel. The forward search from an
anchor `b` looks for the least `n : ℕ` with `w (b + n) = s`; the backward search looks for the least
`n : ℕ` with `w (b - n) = s` — a forward search in the reflected stream, equally measurable. Both
are **totalized** (return `0` if that direction has no sentinel) so they are total functions of the
stream; on the a.e. set where the orbit is tiled by complete columns (the two-sided recurrence
backbone `twoSided_recurrence`) the search always succeeds and the totalization is irrelevant. -/

/-- The totalized forward-search predicate: a sentinel `s` sits at coordinate `b + n`, **or** the
forward ray from `b` contains no sentinel at all. The disjunction guarantees a witness for every
stream (`exists_fwd`), so `Nat.find` is total and `measurable_find` applies. -/

/-! ### The block around coordinate `0`: start, length, content

The sentinel block containing coordinate `0` is delimited by the nearest sentinels on either side.
We take the **block start** to be one past the nearest sentinel strictly before coordinate `0`
(found by the backward search anchored at `-1`), and the **block end** to be the nearest sentinel at
coordinate `≥ 0` (the forward search anchored at `0`). The **content** is the window from start to
end inclusive — exactly one sentinel-terminated block in the well-tiled (a.e.) case. Each of
`blockStart`, `blockLen` is a measurable integer/nat function of the stream, built from the
measurable sentinel distances. -/

/-- **The start of the sentinel block containing coordinate `0`.** One past the nearest sentinel
strictly before `0`: anchoring the backward search at `-1` finds the distance `d` to that sentinel
(`w (-1 - d) = s`), and the block starts at `-1 - d + 1 = -d`. (In the no-sentinel-below case the
totalized search returns `d = 0`, giving start `0`; this only happens off the a.e. tiled set.) -/
noncomputable def blockStart (s : Fin k) (w : ℤ → Fin k) : ℤ :=
  -(bwdSentinel s (-1) w : ℤ)

/-- **The end coordinate of the sentinel block containing coordinate `0`.** The nearest sentinel at

/-! ### The parser and its measurability — the headline of this file

The parser applies a decode map `dec : List (Fin k) → κ` to the block content. Its measurability is
proved by the countable-codomain route (`measurable_to_countable'`): each preimage
`{w | dec (blockContent s w) = j}` decomposes over the countably many block shapes `(b, L, l)` as a
union of cylinders `{blockStart = b} ∩ {blockLen = L} ∩ {window b L = l}`. This is the measurable
bi-infinite sentinel parser that `Recovery` isolated as the residual with no Mathlib analogue. -/

/-- **The bi-infinite sentinel parser.** Given a block-decode map `dec : List (Fin k) → κ`, the
parser `sentinelParse s dec w` reads off the sentinel block of the bi-infinite stream `w` containing
coordinate `0` (`blockContent s w`) and decodes it. This is the decoder `D` of
`Oseledets.Krieger.ColumnCodeData`, now an *honest* total function rather than a hypothesis. -/

(`measurable_blockStart`, `measurable_blockLen`, `measurableSet_window_eq`), `List (Fin k)` is

/-! ### The sharpened residual: a code symbol + a.e. parse correctness ⇒ `ColumnCodeData`

With the parser constructed and proved measurable, the `ColumnCodeData` residual sharpens: the
decoder is no longer a hypothesis. The remaining *genuinely dynamical* input is a measurable code
symbol `c : α → Fin k` (built from the tower columns + sentinel encoding) and the a.e. *correctness*
of the sentinel parse — that off a μ-null set the parser applied to the two-sided itinerary of a
point recovers the `Q`-name, i.e. recovers which `Q`-cell it lies in. We package this as
`SentinelColumnCode` and show it yields a full `ColumnCodeData`. This is the honest reduction of
sub-problem B to its dynamical core, with the measurable-parse infrastructure fully discharged. -/

/-- **The sharpened column-code residual.** Bundles exactly the genuinely *dynamical* inputs of
sub-problem B that remain after the measurable bi-infinite parser is constructed:

* `code` (+ `code_measurable`): the measurable code symbol `c : α → Fin k`, built from the refining
  Rokhlin towers so that `c (eⁱ x)` spells the `i`-th symbol of the sentinel block of the column
  through `x` (points (1), (2) of the `Recovery` note);
* `decode`: the per-block decode map `List (Fin k) → κ` (strip the sentinel, look up the `Q`-name —
  the *finite* unique-decodability of `Oseledets.Krieger.sentinelEncodeList_injective`); and
* `recovers`: the a.e. *correctness* of the sentinel parse — for each `Q`-cell `j`, `Q j` agrees
  `μ`-a.e. with `{x | sentinelParse s decode (itin e code x) = j}` (point (4), the `m → ∞` /
  Borel–Cantelli limit over the two-sided recurrence tiling).

This is strictly sharper than `Oseledets.Krieger.ColumnCodeData`: the decoder is no longer supplied
or assumed measurable — it is the **constructed, proved-measurable** parser `sentinelParse s decode`
of this file. -/

measurable code symbol, a per-block decode map, and the a.e. correctness of the *constructed*
sentinel parse — the decoder field is filled by `sentinelParse sentinel decode`, which is measurable
by `measurable_sentinelParse` (the headline of this file), and the recovery field is the supplied
a.e. correctness. So the only inputs left are dynamical: the code symbol and the a.e. parse
correctness. The measurable bi-infinite parser, flagged as the residual with no Mathlib analogue, is
**discharged** — it is `sentinelParse` with its `measurable_sentinelParse` certificate. -/

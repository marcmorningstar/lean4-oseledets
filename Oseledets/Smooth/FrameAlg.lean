# The fixed framing algebra `E ≃ₐ Matrix` of an inner-product model fibre

For a finite-dimensional real inner-product space `E`, conjugating endomorphisms of `E` by a fixed
orthonormal frame `E ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (finrank ℝ E))` and identifying
`EuclideanSpace`-endomorphisms with matrices (`Matrix.toEuclideanCLM`) packages a **globally
constant** algebra equivalence
`frameAlg E : (E →L[ℝ] E) ≃ₐ[ℝ] Matrix (Fin (finrank ℝ E)) (Fin (finrank ℝ E)) ℝ`.

This is the algebraic heart of the bundle-to-matrix reduction of the manifold Oseledets MET: because
it is an algebra equivalence it sends `1 ↦ 1` and products to products, turning a product of
model-fibre endomorphisms (the framed tangent cocycle) into a matrix cocycle without side
conditions; it preserves the L2 operator norm (the framing is an isometry), so the matrix
integrability hypotheses are exactly the genuine `log⁺‖·‖` ones; and it is continuous and
(entrywise) measurable, so a measurable model-fibre cocycle becomes a measurable matrix cocycle.

This file isolates the framing algebra so that both the (superseded) canonical-derivative route
and the unconditional framed-cocycle MET (`Oseledets.Smooth.UnconditionalMET`) can share it
without colliding over the `mfderivHom` definition their measurability imports each introduce.

## Main definitions

* `Oseledets.modelDim E` — `finrank ℝ E`, the matrix side.
* `Oseledets.frameEquiv E` / `frameCLE E` — the fixed orthonormal framing (isometry / CLE).
* `Oseledets.frameAlg E` — the framing algebra equivalence `(E →L[ℝ] E) ≃ₐ Matrix`.

## Main results

* `Oseledets.norm_frameAlg` — the framing preserves the L2 operator norm.
* `Oseledets.continuous_frameAlg` / `measurable_frameAlg` — continuity / measurability.

variable (E) in
/-- The model dimension: `finrank ℝ E`. The tangent spaces of `M` are all (definitionally) `E`, so
this is the fibre dimension of the tangent bundle, and the side of the cocycle matrices. -/
abbrev modelDim : ℕ := Module.finrank ℝ E

variable (E) in
/-- The **fixed framing** of the model fibre: a linear isometry
`E ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (finrank ℝ E))`, obtained from an arbitrary chosen orthonormal
basis (`stdOrthonormalBasis`). Conjugating a tangent-space endomorphism by this isometry turns it
into an endomorphism of `EuclideanSpace`, hence (via `Matrix.toEuclideanCLM`) into a matrix.

Crucially this framing is **globally constant** — it does not depend on the base point `x` —
because Mathlib models every tangent space `TangentSpace I x` on the *same* fixed space `E`. This is
exactly the measurable bundle trivialisation required by the manifold MET, here in its simplest
(constant) incarnation. -/

/-- The framing as a *continuous linear equivalence*
`E ≃L[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (modelDim E))`, the underlying CLE of `frameEquiv`. Conjugating
endomorphisms of `E` by `frameCLE` lands in endomorphisms of `EuclideanSpace`. -/

/-- The **framing algebra isomorphism**: conjugation by `frameCLE` followed by
`toEuclideanCLM.symm`, packaged as an algebra equivalence
`(E →L[ℝ] E) ≃ₐ[ℝ] Matrix (Fin (modelDim E)) (Fin (modelDim E)) ℝ`.

Because it is an algebra equivalence it sends `1 ↦ 1` and products to products; this is precisely
what turns the *bundle* cocycle (a product of endomorphisms along the orbit) into a *matrix* cocycle
without any side conditions. It is the algebraic heart of the bundle-to-matrix reduction.
(Continuity, needed only for the measurability of the matrix generator, is recorded separately in
`continuous_frameAlg`.) -/

`Continuous.measurable` does not apply directly.) -/

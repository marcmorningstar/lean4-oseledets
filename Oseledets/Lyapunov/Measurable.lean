# Measurability infrastructure for the Lyapunov filtration (M7)

This module assembles the measurability tools for milestone `M7`. The strategy (see
`docs/plan/blueprints/m7-measurable-strategy-v2.md`, crux verified by compilation) routes the
measurability of the Oseledets flag **through the concrete continuous-functional-calculus
spectral projections of the Oseledets limit operator** `Λ x = lim_n ((A⁽ⁿ⁾)ᵀ A⁽ⁿ⁾)^{1/(2n)}`,
rather than through a measurable selection of an orthonormal frame for the abstract sublevel
subspace (which would need a Kuratowski–Ryll-Nardzewski selection theorem absent from Mathlib).

Defining the `i`-th flag projection as the CFC element `Pᵢ x := cfc gᵢ (Λ x)` (with `gᵢ` a
continuous gap function) makes `orthProjMatrix (range (toEuclideanCLM (Pᵢ x))) = Pᵢ x`
definitionally — a self-adjoint idempotent equals the orthogonal projection onto its range — so
`MeasurableSubspace` reduces to measurability of `x ↦ cfc gᵢ (Λ x)`.

## What this module provides

* `measurable_lambdaBar_apply` — for fixed `v`, `x ↦ lambdaBar A T x v` is measurable (the scalar
  scaffolding, reused throughout the arc).
* `orthProjMatrix_apply` / `measurable_orthProjMatrix_iff` — the projection matrix's entry formula
  and the resulting reduction of matrix measurability to projecting the fixed standard basis
  vectors.
* `instMeasurableAdd₂Matrix`, `measurable_matrix_pow`, `measurable_aeval_matrix` — matrix-algebra
  measurability (a polynomial in a measurable matrix is measurable).
* `measurable_cfc_eqOn_polynomial` — **the make-or-break crux**: if a fixed polynomial `q` agrees
  with `g` on the spectrum of every (self-adjoint) `M x`, then `x ↦ cfc g (M x)` is measurable.
  This is the polynomial bypass: it uses only the bare Hermitian CFC instance, not the (absent for
  real matrices) `IsometricContinuousFunctionalCalculus`.

The terminal `MeasurableSubspace` lemma for the concrete flag is assembled once the Oseledets
limit `Λ` is available (the Limit module), since it needs `Measurable Λ` and the fixed Lyapunov
spectrum on which the gap function is interpolated by a polynomial.

/-- **THE MAKE-OR-BREAK CRUX.** Let `M : X → Matrix (Fin d) (Fin d) ℝ` be measurable with each
`M x` self-adjoint (Hermitian). Suppose a *fixed* polynomial `q` agrees with `g : ℝ → ℝ` on the
spectrum of every `M x`. Then `x ↦ cfc g (M x)` is measurable.

This is the situation in the measurability route: `M x = Λ x` (the a.e.-existing Oseledets limit
matrix, measurable as a limit of measurable matrices), `g = gᵢ` the continuous gap function, and
on the a.e. good set the spectrum is the fixed gapped Lyapunov set, on which `gᵢ` equals an
interpolating polynomial `q`. It uses only the bare Hermitian CFC instance — no
`IsometricContinuousFunctionalCalculus` (which does not synthesize for real matrices), no
`continuousOn_cfc`, no measurable selection, no analytic sets. -/

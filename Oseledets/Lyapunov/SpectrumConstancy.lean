# Spectrum constancy: identifying the per-point spectrum with the deterministic exponent set

`Oseledets.hspec_of_spectrum_const` (in `FiltrationAssemblyBridge.lean`) reduces the
`hspec` interface of the final assembly to the single hypothesis

```
hspecconst : ∀ᵐ x ∂μ, spectrum A T x = distinctExp lam0 d.
```

This file discharges `hspecconst`.  The per-point limsup spectrum `spectrum A T x` is the
finite set of values of the upper Lyapunov growth function `lambdaBar A T x` on nonzero vectors
(`Oseledets.spectrum`, `Oseledets.mem_spectrum`).  Pinning that finite set to the deterministic
distinct-exponent set `distinctExp lam0 d` is a `Finset.Subset.antisymm` of two per-vector
inclusions:

* **upper inclusion** `spectrum A T x ⊆ distinctExp lam0 d` — every realized `lambdaBar` value is
  one of the deterministic singular-value exponents `lam0 i` (`i < d`).  This is the
  growth→exponent direction; its per-vector core is the spectral upper bound, the genuine
  analytic step of the multiplicative ergodic theorem (via the determinant/tempering squeeze).

* **lower inclusion** `distinctExp lam0 d ⊆ spectrum A T x` — every distinct deterministic exponent
  `lam0 i` is *attained* by some nonzero vector, i.e. lies in the `lambdaBar`-range.  Its per-vector
  core is the lower bound (`log_le_liminf_log_cocycle_apply`) combined with the
  stratum-exact `lambdaBar_eq_on_stratum`.

The two inclusions compose to the constant `distinctExp lam0 d`, so ergodic constancy of the
spectrum is automatic — the limit set is deterministic by construction, hence trivially
`T`-invariant and constant; no separate `Finset ℝ` measurability / ergodic-averaging step
is needed once the identification is in hand.  For completeness we also record, unconditionally
from `spectrum_equivariant_ae` together with ergodicity, that the identification self-propagates: if
it holds it holds at `T x` too, and on the full orbit.

## What is unconditional vs. hypothesis-gated

* `spectrum_eq_of_subsets` and `hspecconst_of_subsets` are unconditional `Finset` algebra: they
  turn the two per-vector inclusions into the Finset identity / the `hspec` interface, using nothing
  but `Oseledets.hspec_of_spectrum_const`.
* `spectrum_const_invariant_ae` is unconditional (from `spectrum_equivariant_ae`): the
  identification, once true a.e., is `T`-invariant a.e.
* The two per-vector inclusion hypotheses `hub_spec` / `hlb_spec` are the analytic interface.  The
  lower one follows from the established lower bound; the upper one is the spectral upper bound.
  They are stated here in a minimal cleanly-typed Finset shape so that the surrounding assembly can
  plug the per-vector outputs in directly.

/-! ## Reducing the inclusions to the native `lambdaBar` shape

The two Finset inclusions are equivalent, on the a.e. good set where `lambdaBar A T x` is an
`IsUltrametricGrowth` function (`isUltrametricGrowth_lambdaBar`), to per-vector `lambdaBar`
statements:

* upper inclusion ⟺ every realized value `lambdaBar A T x v` (`v ≠ 0`) is some `lam0 j` (`j < d`) —
  this is the spectral-upper-bound output (`lambdaBar v = λᵢ` on each stratum,
  the values being the deterministic exponents);
* lower inclusion ⟺ every `lam0 j` (`j < d`) is realized by some nonzero `v` — the attainment/
  lower-bound layer.

These reductions are unconditional `mem_spectrum`/`mem_distinctExp` unfoldings; they let the
per-vector outputs be fed in without first repackaging into Finsets. -/

/-! ## Ergodic constancy of the spectrum

The deterministic target `distinctExp lam0 d` is constant in `x`, so the identification
`spectrum A T x = distinctExp lam0 d` is automatically `T`-invariant.  We make the self-propagation
explicit and unconditional from `spectrum_equivariant_ae`: where the spectrum equals
the deterministic constant and is `A`-equivariant, the same holds at `T x`.  This is the precise
ergodic-constancy content — once the (deterministic) value is identified, ergodicity
adds nothing further, because a deterministic function is already constant. -/

/-- **Self-propagation of the spectrum identity along `T` (a.e.).**  Unconditional from
`spectrum_equivariant_ae`: if a.e. `spectrum A T x = distinctExp lam0 d`, then a.e.
`spectrum A T (T x) = distinctExp lam0 d` as well.  Together with the a.e. equivariance
`spectrum A T x = spectrum A T (T x)` this exhibits the identification as `T`-invariant, i.e. the
spectrum is a.e. equal to the *same* deterministic constant set at `x` and at `T x`. -/

/-! ## End-to-end: the `hspec` interface under the standing hypotheses

Bundling everything: under the standard standing hypotheses, *given* the two analytic per-vector
inclusions, the `hspec` interface (and hence — via the `FiltrationAssemblyBridge` results — the
`oseledets_filtration` `hspec` slot) is discharged.  The signature lists the full standing
hypotheses so it slots directly into the surrounding assembly, even though the proof only needs the
two inclusions; this fixes the *shape* the spectral upper bound must provide. -/

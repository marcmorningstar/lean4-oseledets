# The nonsingular-minor characterisation of rank, and the measurable rank flag

For the singular (non-invertible) multiplicative ergodic theorem the Oseledets
decomposition degenerates to a **measurable filtration**
`ℝ^d = V₁(x) ⊃ V₂(x) ⊃ ⋯ ⊃ {0}`, whose strata carry the dimension data (the
multiplicities `m_j`) of the flag (A. Quas, *Multiplicative Ergodic Theorems and
Applications*, lecture notes, Universidade de São Paulo, December 2013, Theorem 2 —
the non-invertible Oseledets theorem after Oseledec [12] and Raghunathan [13]: in
the non-invertible case the conclusion is a **measurable** filtration rather than a
direct-sum decomposition). Assembling that measurable flag requires the *dimension
function* `x ↦ cocycleRank A T n x` to be measurable, which rests on the
determinantal characterisation of rank via minors.

`Oseledets.Lyapunov.Extensions.SingularRankMeasurable2` supplied the **easy half** of
that characterisation — a nonsingular `r × r` minor forces `r ≤ M.rank`
(`Matrix.le_rank_of_submatrix_det_ne_zero`) — and exhibited the union of the
nonsingular-minor sets as a measurable **subset** of `{x | r ≤ cocycleRank A T n x}`.

This file proves the **classical hard half**, absent from Mathlib:

> `r ≤ M.rank ⇒ ∃ s t : Fin r → n, (M.submatrix s t).det ≠ 0`,

i.e. a matrix of rank at least `r` has a nonsingular `r × r` minor. Combined with
the easy half it gives the full minor characterisation
`r ≤ M.rank ↔ ∃ s t, (M.submatrix s t).det ≠ 0`, which upgrades the subset above to a
set **equality**, yielding `MeasurableSet {x | r ≤ cocycleRank A T n x}`, then the
measurability of the dimension function `cocycleRank A T n` and of the
eventual-kernel dimension `x ↦ d - ⨅ n, cocycleRank A T n x` — the dimension datum of
the measurable flag.

## The classical proof of the hard half

The standard linear-algebra argument (chosen here because every step is supported by
the Mathlib API):

1. `M.rank` is the dimension of the **column span** (`rank_eq_finrank_span_cols`); from
   a finite family whose span has dimension `≥ r` one can select an injective family of
   `r` indices on which the family is linearly independent
   (`Matrix.exists_submatrix_id_rank_eq`, built from `exists_linearIndependent'` and
   `finrank_span_eq_card`). This produces `t : Fin r → n` with the tall `m × r`
   submatrix `M.submatrix id t` of rank `r`.
2. Applying the same column selection to the **transpose** of that tall submatrix
   selects `r` independent rows, giving `s : Fin r → m` so that the square
   `r × r` minor `M.submatrix s t` again has rank `r`.
3. A square matrix of full rank has nonzero determinant
   (`Matrix.rank_eq_card_iff_det_ne_zero`).

## Main results

* `Matrix.exists_submatrix_id_rank_eq`: rank `≥ r` selects `t : Fin r → n` with the
  tall column-submatrix `M.submatrix id t` of rank exactly `r`.
* `Matrix.exists_submatrix_det_ne_zero_of_le_rank`: **the missing lemma** — rank `≥ r`
  yields a nonsingular `r × r` minor.
* `Matrix.le_rank_iff_exists_submatrix_det_ne_zero`: the full minor characterisation
  of rank (both directions).
* `Oseledets.measurableSet_le_cocycleRank`: `{x | r ≤ cocycleRank A T n x}` is
  measurable.
* `Oseledets.measurable_cocycleRank`: the cocycle-rank dimension function is
  measurable.

/-- **Column selection from a rank bound.** If `r ≤ M.rank` then there is an injective
selection `t : Fin r → n` of `r` columns of `M` whose tall `m × r` submatrix
`M.submatrix id t` has rank exactly `r`.

Proof: `M.rank` equals the dimension of the column span (`rank_eq_finrank_span_cols`).
From the column family `M.col : n → (m → R)`, `exists_linearIndependent'` selects an
injective `a : κ → n` indexing a linearly independent subfamily with the same span,
hence (`finrank_span_eq_card`) `Fintype.card κ = M.rank ≥ r`; choosing an injection
`Fin r ↪ κ` and composing gives `t`. The columns of `M.submatrix id t` are exactly
`M.col ∘ t`, a linearly independent `Fin r`-family, so the submatrix's rank is `r`. -/

/-- **The missing nonsingular-minor lemma** (classical hard half of the minor
characterisation of rank). If `r ≤ M.rank`, then some `r × r` minor of `M` is
nonsingular: there exist `s t : Fin r → n` with `(M.submatrix s t).det ≠ 0`.

Proof. First select `r` independent columns: `exists_submatrix_id_rank_eq` gives
`t : Fin r → n` with the tall submatrix `N := M.submatrix id t` of rank `r`. The
transpose `Nᵀ` has the same rank `r` (`rank_transpose`); selecting `r` independent
columns of `Nᵀ` (again `exists_submatrix_id_rank_eq`) gives `s : Fin r → m` with
`(Nᵀ.submatrix id s).rank = r`. That selection is the square minor `M.submatrix s t`
up to transpose, and a square matrix of full rank has nonzero determinant
(`rank_eq_card_iff_det_ne_zero`). The converse — a nonsingular minor forcing
`r ≤ M.rank` — is `Matrix.le_rank_of_submatrix_det_ne_zero`. -/

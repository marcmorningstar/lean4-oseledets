# The eventual (stabilized) kernel of a singular linear cocycle

For a non-invertible (singular) cocycle the Oseledets multiplicative ergodic theorem
degenerates from a direct-sum decomposition to a **filtration**
`ℝ^d = V₁(ω) ⊃ V₂(ω) ⊃ ⋯ ⊃ V_k(ω) ⊃ {0}`, whose bottom space `{0}` is the limit of the
directions the matrix products ultimately collapse. This file builds the **eventual
kernel** of the cocycle: the supremum (union) over all step counts `n` of the finite-`n`
kernel submodules `Oseledets.cocycleKer A T n x`. Since the kernel family is monotone
(`cocycleKer_le_add`: once a direction is collapsed it stays collapsed), this supremum is
the *stabilized* bottom stratum of the singular Oseledets flag — the eventual kernel
`⨆ n, cocycleKer A T n x`.

Two facts are recorded: the kernel family is monotone in the step count
(`cocycleKer_mono`), and each finite-step kernel embeds in the eventual one
(`cocycleKer_le_eventualKer`). A crude dimension bound `finrank ≤ d`
(`finrank_eventualKer_le`) follows from the ambient finite dimension.

Literature source (impl-i6-evker): A. Quas, *Multiplicative Ergodic Theorems and
Applications* (lecture notes, Universidade de São Paulo, 2013), **Theorem 2** (Oseledets
theorem, non-invertible form; after Oseledec [12] and Raghunathan [13]). There the
non-invertible conclusion is the measurable filtration `ℝ^d = V₁(ω) ⊃ V₂(ω) ⊃ ⋯ ⊃
V_{k+1}(ω) = {0}` with `A_ω V_j(ω) ⊆ V_j(σ ω)`; the bottom `V_{k+1}(ω) = {0}` is the
stabilized kernel — the directions collapsed in the limit — which the eventual kernel of
this file makes concrete as the monotone supremum of the finite-`n` step kernels.

## Main definitions

* `Oseledets.eventualKer`: the eventual kernel `⨆ n, cocycleKer A T n x`, the stabilized
  union of all step-kernels and the monotone-limit bottom of the singular filtration flag.

## Main results

* `Oseledets.cocycleKer_mono`: the step-kernel family `fun n => cocycleKer A T n x` is
  monotone in the step count `n` (collapsed directions stay collapsed).
* `Oseledets.cocycleKer_le_eventualKer`: each finite-step kernel `cocycleKer A T n x`
  sits inside the eventual kernel `eventualKer A T x`.
* `Oseledets.finrank_eventualKer_le`: the eventual kernel has dimension at most `d`.

## Remaining gap toward the measurable equivariant flag

This module supplies the *stabilized bottom* `eventualKer A T x` of the flag as an
algebraic supremum at a fixed base point `x`. The full Quas Theorem 2 conclusion still
requires: (i) the singular-value exponents `λ₁ > ⋯ > λ_k` from the Kingman/exterior-power
machinery; (ii) the limiting slow spaces `V_j(ω)` as Cauchy limits in the Grassmannian of
spans of the smallest singular vectors of `cocycle A T n x`; (iii) measurability of
`x ↦ V_j(x)` and the equivariance `A_ω V_j(ω) ⊆ V_j(σ ω)`. In particular the eventual
kernel here is *not yet* shown to be equivariant (`A x` mapping `eventualKer A T x` into
`eventualKer A T (T x)`) nor measurable in `x`; only the per-base-point monotone-limit
algebra is formalized.

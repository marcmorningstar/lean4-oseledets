# Measurability of the singular rank data

For the singular (non-invertible) multiplicative ergodic theorem the Oseledets
decomposition degenerates to a **measurable filtration**
`ℝ^d = V₁(x) ⊃ V₂(x) ⊃ ⋯ ⊃ {0}` whose strata carry the dimension data of the
flag (Quas, *Multiplicative Ergodic Theorems and Applications*, lecture notes,
Universidade de São Paulo, 2013, Theorem 2 — the non-invertible Oseledets theorem
after Oseledec [12] and Raghunathan [13]: the filtration is **measurable** and its
dimensions are the multiplicities `m_j`). A prerequisite for assembling that
measurable flag is that the *dimension data* of the cocycle — the rank of each
matrix product, and the level sets of that rank — depend measurably on the base
point `x`.

This file supplies the determinantal building blocks of that measurability.

The crux for the **full** rank function `x ↦ (A x).rank` is the determinantal
characterisation of rank: `r ≤ (A x).rank` iff some `r × r` minor of `A x` has
nonzero determinant, which would express each level set as a finite union of the
measurable sets `{x | minor-det ≠ 0}`. That equivalence (rank ↔ nonzero minors) is
**not** in Mathlib, so the general `Measurable (fun x => (A x).rank)` cannot yet be
proved here; see the module note at the end.

What *is* available is the **top stratum** of the flag — the full-rank set — via the
square determinantal characterisation `A.rank = d ↔ A.det ≠ 0`, which this file
proves (`Matrix.rank_eq_card_iff_det_ne_zero`) and turns into measurability of the
top-rank level set of the cocycle.

## Main results

* `Oseledets.measurable_minor_det`: for a measurable matrix family `A`, the
  determinant of any fixed `r × r` minor `x ↦ ((A x).submatrix s t).det` is
  measurable. (A single minor — the elementary piece of the determinantal-rank
  union.)
* `Oseledets.measurableSet_minor_det_ne_zero`: the set where a fixed minor is
  nondegenerate, `{x | ((A x).submatrix s t).det ≠ 0}`, is measurable.
* `Matrix.rank_eq_card_iff_det_ne_zero`: for a square matrix over a field,
  `A.rank = Fintype.card n ↔ A.det ≠ 0` (the full-rank determinantal criterion).
* `Oseledets.measurableSet_cocycleRank_eq_full`: the top stratum of the rank flag,
  `{x | cocycleRank A T n x = d}`, is measurable.

## Remaining gap

The full measurable dimension function `x ↦ cocycleRank A T n x` (hence the
eventual-kernel dimension `x ↦ d - iInf_n cocycleRank A T n x`) requires the
rank ↔ nonzero-minor equivalence that Mathlib still lacks; see the closing note.

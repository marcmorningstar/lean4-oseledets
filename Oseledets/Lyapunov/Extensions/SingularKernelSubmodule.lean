# The collapsing-kernel submodule of a singular linear cocycle

For a non-invertible (singular) cocycle the Oseledets multiplicative ergodic theorem
degenerates from a direct-sum decomposition to a **filtration**
`ℝ^d = V₁(ω) ⊃ V₂(ω) ⊃ ⋯ ⊃ V_k(ω) ⊃ {0}`, and the bottom space of that flag is the
*eventual kernel* — the directions the matrix products ultimately collapse. This file
records the finite-`n` building block of that bottom space: the **kernel submodule**
`Oseledets.cocycleKer A T n x`, the set of vectors annihilated by the `n`-step cocycle.

The headline result is **kernel monotonicity along the orbit**: once a direction is
collapsed by the cocycle it stays collapsed, so the kernel can only grow as the cocycle
composes (`cocycleKer_le_add`). Together with the rank–nullity identity
`finrank (cocycleKer) = d - cocycleRank` (`finrank_cocycleKer`) this is the dimension
data of the bottom stratum of the singular filtration. The full measurable flag
`V₁(ω) ⊃ ⋯ ⊃ {0}` of the singular MET is *not* constructed here; see the module note
below for the precise remaining gap.

Literature source (impl-i6-flag): A. Quas, *Multiplicative Ergodic Theorems and
Applications* (lecture notes, Universidade de São Paulo, 2013), **Theorem 2** (Oseledets
theorem, non-invertible form; after Oseledec [12] and Raghunathan [13]). There the
non-invertible conclusion is the measurable filtration `ℝ^d = V₁(ω) ⊃ V₂(ω) ⊃ ⋯ ⊃
V_{k+1}(ω) = {0}` with `A_ω V_j(ω) ⊆ V_j(σ ω)`; the bottom `V_{k+1}(ω) = {0}` together
with the equivariance `A_ω V_j(ω) ⊆ V_j(σ ω)` is the abstraction the kernel submodule
of this file makes concrete at finite `n`.

## Main definitions

* `Oseledets.cocycleKer`: the kernel `LinearMap.ker (cocycle A T n x).mulVecLin` of the
  `n`-step cocycle — the directions collapsed after `n` steps.

## Main results

* `Oseledets.cocycleKer_zero`: `cocycleKer A T 0 x = ⊥` (the zero-step cocycle is the
  identity, with trivial kernel).
* `Oseledets.cocycleKer_le_add`: **kernel monotonicity** —
  `cocycleKer A T n x ≤ cocycleKer A T (m + n) x`: collapsed directions stay collapsed,
  so the kernel only grows as the cocycle composes along the orbit.
* `Oseledets.finrank_cocycleKer`: the rank–nullity identity
  `finrank (cocycleKer A T n x) = d - (cocycle A T n x).rank` — the kernel dimension is
  the corank of the `n`-step cocycle.

## Remaining gap toward the full singular filtration

This module supplies the *bottom* of the flag at finite time: a single monotone family
of kernel submodules with its dimension. The full Quas Theorem 2 conclusion additionally
requires (i) the singular-value exponents `λ₁ > ⋯ > λ_k` from the Kingman/exterior-power
machinery, (ii) the limiting slow spaces `V_j(ω) = lim_n (span of the smallest singular
vectors of `cocycle A T n x`) as a Cauchy sequence in the Grassmannian, and (iii) their
measurability and equivariance `A_ω V_j(ω) ⊆ V_j(σ ω)`. None of (i)–(iii) is formalized
here; only the algebraic kernel/corank data is.

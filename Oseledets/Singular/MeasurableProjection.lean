# Weak measurability of a subspace family from its measurable graph

This module discharges the last genuinely measure-theoretic node of the singular ("issue #6")
multiplicative ergodic theorem: from a **measurable graph** `{(x, v) | v ∈ V x}` of a
subspace-valued family `V : X → Submodule ℝ (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d))` over a **standard Borel**
base `X`, the scalar distance maps `x ↦ infDist c (V x)` are `μ`-a.e. measurable
(`AEMeasurable`). This is exactly the weak-measurability hypothesis consumed by the (`sorry`-free)
polarisation converter of `Oseledets.Singular.StarProjectionPolar`
(`Oseledets.starProjection_apply_coord`), now in its a.e. form.

## The route: projection of a Borel set is analytic, analytic sets are universally measurable

The sublevel set splits as a projection of the graph:
`{x | infDist c (V x) < r} = Prod.fst '' ({(x, v) | v ∈ V x} ∩ (Set.univ ×ˢ Metric.ball c r))`
(`infDist_lt_iff`, using `0 ∈ V x` for nonemptiness). The right-hand side is the image, under the
**continuous** projection `Prod.fst : X × EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d) → X`, of a measurable subset of
the standard Borel product `X × EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)`. By the Lusin–Souslin machinery in
Mathlib (`MeasurableSet.analyticSet_image`) such an image is an **analytic set**.

Analytic sets in a standard Borel space are **universally measurable**: each is `NullMeasurableSet`
with respect to (the completion of) every s-finite measure — the classical theorem of Lusin via
Choquet capacitability. *Mathlib has the analytic-set API but not this universal-measurability
theorem* (`AnalyticSet.measurableSet_of_compl` only delivers measurability for analytic sets whose
complement is also analytic — Suslin's theorem — which does not apply to a projection in general).
This fact is now **proved** in `Oseledets.MeasureTheory.AnalyticUniversallyMeasurable`
(`MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.nullMeasurableSet`, via the Choquet capacity machinery), and consumed
here through `nullMeasurableSet_infDist_lt`.

Granted that classical fact, every sublevel set is `NullMeasurableSet`, hence `x ↦ infDist c
(V x)` is `NullMeasurable` (via `measurable_of_Iio` on the `NullMeasurableSpace` σ-algebra), hence
`AEMeasurable` (`NullMeasurable.aemeasurable`, ℝ being countably generated). This is the correct
a.e. formulation for the (a.e.) multiplicative ergodic theorem.

## Why this is the right reduction

`infDist c (V x) = ‖c − (V x).starProjection c‖` (`Oseledets.infDist_eq_norm_sub_starProjection`),
so the weak measurability proved here is interderivable with measurability of the orthogonal
projector itself: the node is irreducible, and reducing it to *one* universally-true classical
measure-theory lemma (analytic ⟹ universally measurable) is the sharpest possible isolation —
strictly tighter than the Arsenin–Kunugui "σ-compact sections" route, which the present analytic
argument bypasses entirely.

## Main results

* `Oseledets.analyticSet_infDist_lt`: under `[StandardBorelSpace X]`, a measurable graph makes
  `{x | infDist c (V x) < r}` an `AnalyticSet` (`sorry`-free).
* `Oseledets.nullMeasurableSet_infDist_lt`: the sublevel sets are `NullMeasurableSet` (using the now
  proved `MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.nullMeasurableSet`).
* `Oseledets.aemeasurable_infDist_of_measurableGraph`: **the deliverable** — a measurable graph
  yields `AEMeasurable (fun x => infDist c (V x)) μ` for every `c` and every s-finite measure `μ`.

/-- **A measurable graph yields a.e. weak measurability (the deliverable, a.e. form).** Over a
standard Borel base `X` and for every s-finite measure `μ` (in particular every finite/probability
measure, e.g. the measure of the multiplicative ergodic theorem), a measurable graph
`{(x, v) | v ∈ V x}` makes `x ↦ infDist c (V x)` `AEMeasurable` for every `c`.

Each `Iio`-preimage `{x | infDist c (V x) < r}` is `NullMeasurableSet`
(`nullMeasurableSet_infDist_lt`); `measurable_of_Iio` over the `NullMeasurableSpace` σ-algebra
upgrades this to `NullMeasurable (fun x => infDist c (V x)) μ`, and `NullMeasurable.aemeasurable`
(ℝ countably generated) to `AEMeasurable`. This is the a.e. analogue of pointwise weak
measurability (`x ↦ infDist c (V x)` measurable), the correct hypothesis for the a.e.
multiplicative ergodic theorem. -/

# Measurability of the return time and the return-time exponent ratio

This module records two measurability facts about the suspension cross-section schedule that are
needed to make the special-flow Lyapunov exponent set *measurable* in the base point. Both are
read off mechanically from existing measurability infrastructure.

The first is that, for each lap index `n`, the return time `returnTime T hτ n x` (the flow time
elapsed over `n` base returns) is a measurable function of the base point `x`. By definition
`returnTime T hτ n x = roofSum T hτ (n : ℤ) x = -(suspensionAct T hτ (n : ℤ) (x, 0)).2`, so this
follows from the measurability of the integer iterates of the suspension action
(`measurable_suspensionAct`, of `Oseledets.Continuous.SuspensionFlowMP`).

The second is that the return-time exponent ratio
`x ↦ Real.log ‖cocycle A (⇑T) n x‖ / returnTime T hτ n x` is measurable, combining the
measurability of the discrete log-norm cocycle (`measurable_logNorm_cocycle`, of
`Oseledets.Cocycle.FurstenbergKesten`) with the measurability of the return time. This is the
per-index input to `MeasureTheory.measurableSet_tendsto`, which downstream turns the discrete
return-time exponent convergence set into a measurable set.

## Main results

* `Oseledets.measurable_returnTime`: the return time `x ↦ returnTime T hτ n x` is measurable.
* `Oseledets.measurable_logNorm_div_returnTime`: the return-time exponent ratio
  `x ↦ Real.log ‖cocycle A (⇑T) n x‖ / returnTime T hτ n x` is measurable.

/-- **Measurability of the return time.** For each lap index `n`, the flow time `returnTime T hτ n
x` elapsed over `n` base returns is a measurable function of the base point `x`. It is the negated
`ℝ`-coordinate of the `n`-th integer iterate of the suspension action started at height `0`
(`returnTime T hτ n x = -(suspensionAct T hτ (n : ℤ) (x, 0)).2`), so it is measurable by
`measurable_suspensionAct`. -/

/-- **Measurability of the return-time exponent ratio.** For each lap index `n`, the rescaled
log-norm `x ↦ Real.log ‖cocycle A (⇑T) n x‖ / returnTime T hτ n x` is a measurable function of the

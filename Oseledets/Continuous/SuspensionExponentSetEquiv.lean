# The full-time exponent set equals the discrete return-time exponent set

This module proves the **set equality** that lets the full-time special-flow Lyapunov-exponent set
be recognised as measurable. For a fixed value `L : ℝ`, the set of base points carrying the
full-time cover-cocycle growth rate `L`,

`{x | Real.log ‖coverCocycle A T hτ hc hcpos (x, 0) t‖ / t → L  as t → ∞}`,

coincides — *pointwise in `x`*, under a bounded roof `c ≤ τ ≤ C` — with the set of base points
carrying the discrete return-time growth rate `L`,

`{x | Real.log ‖cocycle A (⇑T) n x‖ / returnTime T hτ n x → L  as n → ∞}`.

The two inclusions are the two halves of the between-returns squeeze, run *per point* rather than
`μ`-a.e.:

* **Full ⟹ discrete** (`tendsto_returnTimeExp_of_coverCocycle`). Sample the full-time limit along
  the return-time subsequence `t = returnTime T hτ n x`, which tends to `+∞`
  (`returnTime_tendsto_atTop`); the cover-cocycle norm at a return time equals the base cocycle norm
  (`coverCocycle_returnTime_norm_eq`), so the sampled full-time ratio is exactly the discrete
  return-time ratio. This direction needs only the positive *lower* roof bound.

* **Discrete ⟹ full** (`tendsto_coverCocycle_of_returnTimeExp`). This is the per-point core of
  `coverCocycle_tendsto_exponent_of_bddRoof`: factor the full-time ratio as the time-distortion
  factor `returnTime (lapCount t x) x / t` (which `→ 1` by `lapCount_returnTime_div_tendsto_one`,
  the bounded-roof input) times the discrete exponent ratio evaluated at the lap count (which `→ L`
  by composing the discrete hypothesis with `lapCount_tendsto_atTop`). The product factorization is
  `log_coverCocycle_div_eq_lapCount`. This direction genuinely needs the uniform *upper* roof bound
  `τ ≤ C`.

The normal form of the discrete set is fixed exactly as
`Real.log ‖cocycle A (⇑T) n x‖ / returnTime T hτ n x` so that the downstream measurability rewrite
(`Oseledets.Continuous.SuspensionExponentSetMeasurable`) lands on a
`MeasureTheory.measurableSet_tendsto` shape with the per-index measurability supplied by
`measurable_logNorm_div_returnTime`.

This is the special-flow / flow-under-a-roof construction of Cornfeld–Fomin–Sinai, *Ergodic Theory*
(Springer 1982), Ch. 11 (special/suspension flows; Ambrose–Kakutani); the Lyapunov-exponent
analogue of Abramov's entropy formula `h(flow) = h(base)/∫τ`.

## Main results

* `Oseledets.tendsto_returnTimeExp_of_coverCocycle`: full-time exponent ⟹ discrete return-time
  exponent (sampling along the returns).
* `Oseledets.tendsto_coverCocycle_of_returnTimeExp`: discrete return-time exponent ⟹ full-time
  exponent (the bounded-roof between-returns squeeze, per point).
* `Oseledets.coverCocycle_exponent_set_eq`: the two exponent sets coincide, for every value `L`.

/-- **Full-time exponent ⟹ discrete return-time exponent.** If the cover-cocycle log-norm rescaled
by the elapsed flow time `t` tends to `L` as the real `t → ∞`, then the discrete return-time ratio
`Real.log ‖cocycle A (⇑T) n x‖ / returnTime T hτ n x` tends to `L` as `n → ∞`. The discrete ratio is
the full-time ratio sampled along the return-time subsequence `t = returnTime T hτ n x` (which tends
to `+∞`, `returnTime_tendsto_atTop`), and the cover-cocycle norm at a return time equals the base
cocycle norm (`coverCocycle_returnTime_norm_eq`). Needs only the lower roof bound `0 < c ≤ τ`. -/

/-- **The full-time exponent set equals the discrete return-time exponent set.** For a fixed value
`L`, under a bounded roof `c ≤ τ ≤ C`, the set of base points whose full-time cover-cocycle growth
rate is `L` coincides with the set of base points whose discrete return-time growth rate is `L`:

`{x | log ‖coverCocycle (x, 0) t‖ / t → L} = {x | log ‖cocycle A (⇑T) n x‖ / returnTime n x → L}`.

This is the two-sided between-returns squeeze, run per point. The forward inclusion samples along
the returns (`tendsto_returnTimeExp_of_coverCocycle`), the reverse runs the bounded-roof squeeze
(`tendsto_coverCocycle_of_returnTimeExp`). -/

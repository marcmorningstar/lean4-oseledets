# Analytic sets are universally measurable (Choquet capacitability)

This module discharges the single classical measure-theoretic residual of the singular
("issue #6") multiplicative ergodic theorem: **every analytic set in a standard Borel space is
`NullMeasurableSet` for every (finite, σ-finite) measure** — the classical universal-measurability
theorem of Lusin, obtained via Choquet's capacitability theorem.

Mathlib provides the analytic-set construction (`MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet`) and the Lusin
separation / Suslin theorems (`AnalyticSet.measurablySeparable`,
`AnalyticSet.measurableSet_of_compl`), but **not** universal measurability: Suslin's theorem needs
the complement to be analytic too, which a Borel projection does not satisfy. The capacitability
route used here needs no analytic complement.

## The route

For a finite Borel measure `μ` on a Polish space, the *compact capacity*
`compactCap μ s = sSup {μ K | K compact, K ⊆ s}` agrees with `μ s` on analytic sets — this is
**Choquet's capacitability theorem** (`AnalyticSet.compactCap_eq`). The proof parametrises the
analytic set as `f(ℕ → ℕ)` for continuous `f`, builds a coordinate-bound sequence `N : ℕ → ℕ` by
induction (each coordinate via continuity of the capacity along increasing unions), and identifies
the decreasing intersection of closures of cylinder images with the *compact* image `f '' Bnd N`
(`iInter_closure_image_cyl_eq`, a truncation + sequential-compactness argument). See Kechris,
*Classical Descriptive Set Theory*, Theorem 30.13.

From `compactCap μ s = μ s` (`μ` finite) an increasing union `B` of compact subsets of `s` has
`μ B = μ s < ∞`; Carathéodory splitting `μ s = μ B + μ (s \ B)` then forces `μ (s \ B) = 0`, so
`s =ᵐ[μ] B` with `B` Borel: `NullMeasurableSet s μ` (`AnalyticSet.nullMeasurableSet_of_finite`).
The σ-finite case follows by exhausting with finite-measure pieces
(`AnalyticSet.nullMeasurableSet`).

## Main results

* `MeasureTheory.IsChoquetCapacity`: the three Choquet-capacity axioms.
* `MeasureTheory.measure_isChoquetCapacity`: finite Borel measures on Polish spaces are capacities.
* `MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.cap_eq_iSup_isCompact`: Choquet's capacitability theorem (abstract).
* `MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.compactCap_eq`: for analytic sets, compact capacity = measure.
* `MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.nullMeasurableSet_of_finite`: an analytic set is `NullMeasurableSet`
  for every finite measure.
* `MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.nullMeasurableSet`: the deliverable — an analytic set is
  `NullMeasurableSet` for every σ-finite measure.

/-! ## Compact capacity -/

/-- Compact capacity of a set `s` relative to a measure `μ`: the supremum of `μ K` over
compact subsets `K ⊆ s`. The inner-regularity functional whose equality with `μ s`
characterises measurability for analytic sets. -/

of compact subsets and so the supremum. -/

/-! ## Choquet capacity structure -/

/-- Bundled record of the three Choquet capacity axioms for a functional
`cap : Set α → ℝ≥0∞`: monotonicity, sequential continuity from below along increasing
unions, and sequential continuity from above along decreasing intersections of *closed*
sets. The third axiom is what distinguishes a capacity from a general outer measure; it
is the asymmetry that makes the capacitability theorem possible. Every finite Borel
measure on a Polish space is a Choquet capacity (`measure_isChoquetCapacity`). -/

/-! ## Finite Borel measures on Polish spaces are Choquet capacities -/

/-- Every finite Borel measure on a Polish space is a Choquet capacity. Monotonicity
and the increasing-union axiom are immediate from `measure_mono` and `measure_iUnion`;
the decreasing-closed-intersection axiom uses Mathlib's `Antitone.measure_iInter` for
finite measures on closed sets. The instance that lets the abstract capacitability
machinery be applied to ordinary probability measures. -/

/-- For Borel-measurable sets, `compactCap μ s = μ s`. Two-sided bound: monotonicity
gives `≤`, and the existing inner regularity of finite Borel measures on Polish spaces
(`MeasurableSet.exists_isCompact_lt_add`) gives `≥`. The easy half of the
capacitability statement; the analytic-set half requires the cylinder construction in
the rest of the file. -/

/-- **Analytic sets are universally measurable (the isolated classical residual, now proved).**
Every analytic set in a standard Borel (Polish) space is `NullMeasurableSet` with respect to every
σ-finite measure `μ` — the classical universal-measurability theorem of Lusin, via Choquet's
capacitability theorem.

The finite case is `nullMeasurableSet_of_finite`. For a general s-finite `μ`, Mathlib's
`exists_isFiniteMeasure_absolutelyContinuous` supplies a *finite* measure `ν` with `μ ≪ ν`; the
finite case gives `NullMeasurableSet s ν`, and `NullMeasurableSet.mono_ac` transports it back along
`μ ≪ ν` to `NullMeasurableSet s μ`. This covers in particular every finite and σ-finite measure,
hence every probability measure (such as the measure of the multiplicative ergodic theorem). -/

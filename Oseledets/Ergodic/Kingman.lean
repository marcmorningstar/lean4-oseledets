# Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem

Kingman's theorem is the analytic engine of the multiplicative ergodic theorem.
Mathlib has only the *deterministic* Fekete lemma (`Subadditive.tendsto_lim`); the
measure-theoretic a.e.-convergence statement for a **subadditive cocycle** over a
measure-preserving system is absent.

We record the subadditive-cocycle predicate and the theorem. The statement here is in
`ℝ` under the boundedness proviso `BddBelow {(∫ gₙ)/n}` (which keeps the limit finite —
exactly the case used by Furstenberg–Kesten under the `log⁺‖A⁻¹‖ ∈ L¹` hypothesis); the
fully general `EReal`-valued version (limit possibly `−∞`) is a possible refinement.

## Main results

* `Oseledets.IsSubadditiveCocycle`: the subadditive-cocycle predicate
  `g (m + n) x ≤ g m x + g n (T^[m] x)`.
* `Oseledets.tendsto_kingman`: for a measure-preserving `T` on a finite measure space
  and an integrable subadditive cocycle `g` whose normalized integrals are bounded
  below, `gₙ/n` converges `μ`-a.e. to a `T`-invariant integrable limit.
* `Oseledets.tendsto_kingman_ergodic`: under ergodicity the a.e. limit is constant.

## Strategy (pointwise Katznelson–Weiss / Steele)

The a.e. convergence is closed by a *pointwise* sandwich, mirroring the Birkhoff proof in
`Oseledets.Ergodic.Birkhoff`. Write `c n x := g (n+1) x / (n+1)`, `f₊ x := limsup_n (c n x)`,
`f₋ x := liminf_n (c n x)`. The target limit is `G := f₋`. The convergence
`Tendsto (c · x) atTop (𝓝 (f₋ x))` follows pointwise from
`tendsto_of_le_liminf_of_limsup_le` once we know, a.e.,

* `f₊ x ≤ f₋ x`  [hard, `ae_limsup_le_liminf_div`]; and
* `f₋ x ≤ f₊ x`  [trivial, `liminf_le_limsup`].

No integral of `f₊`/`f₋` enters the convergence proof. The integral facts are needed only
to certify `Integrable G`, via a single Fatou step (`int_limsup_div_integrable`).

All of this — the pointwise squeeze, the boundedness facts, the envelope integrability, and
the `T`-invariance — is derived (soft arguments) from the core lemma `ae_tendsto_cdiv`
(*for `μ`-a.e. `x`, `c n x` converges to the value `G x` of some integrable `G`*). The hard
analytic core `ae_ereal_limsup_le_liminf` (`limsup = liminf` a.e.) is proved via the
non-positive companion `ae_ereal_limsup_le_liminf_nonpos`, which carries out the argument
of Karlsson §3.3: the `M`-block subsequence squeeze (`limsup_ecdiv_eq_block` /
`liminf_ecdiv_eq_block`), the additive `T^[M]`-Birkhoff assembly (`limsup_block_eq` /
`liminf_block_eq`), and the `E_{α}` contradiction (`measure_gap_set_eq_zero`) closing on
the `β`-maximal inequality `setIntegral_div_le_level`.

## Finiteness hypothesis

`tendsto_kingman` carries `[IsFiniteMeasure μ]`. As for the Birkhoff theorem, the maximal-
inequality machinery needs a finite measure; the Oseledets multiplicative ergodic theorem
only ever calls Kingman for probability measures, where this is automatic.

A.e., the range of `cdiv g · x` is bounded above (immediate from `le_birkhoffSum_one` and
a.e. boundedness of
the Birkhoff averages of `g 1`). The bounded-below direction is the subtle one: subadditivity
gives only upper bounds, so a.e. finiteness of the liminf holds only once a.e. convergence is
known. Accordingly it is derived from the core lemma `ae_tendsto_cdiv` (a convergent sequence
is bounded), defined below. -/

The normalized cocycle may a priori tend to `−∞` on a positive-measure set, where the
`ℝ`-valued `Filter.liminf`/`limsup` return the junk value `0`. To control the relevant
extrema before finiteness is established we coerce the sequence into `EReal`, a
`CompleteLinearOrder` where `Filter.limsup`/`liminf` are total and `liminf ≤ limsup` is
unconditional. The two facts produced here — `limsup < ⊤` (envelope, from
`le_birkhoffSum_one` and Birkhoff convergence) and
`limsup > ⊥` (Fatou) — together with the hard `limsup ≤ liminf` (`ae_ereal_limsup_le_liminf`)
pin the `EReal` `limsup`/`liminf` to a common finite value, from which the `ℝ` convergence
follows. -/

/-! ### The Fatou step: finiteness of the limsup and integrability of `f₊`

The normalized cocycle satisfies `cdiv g n x ≤ birkhoffAverage ℝ T (g 1) (n+1) x`
(`le_birkhoffSum_one`), so the
nonnegative defect `d n x := birkhoffAverage ℝ T (g 1) (n+1) x − cdiv g n x ≥ 0` controls how
far `cdiv` can drop. A single `ℝ≥0∞` Fatou pass (`lintegral_liminf_le`) on `ENNReal.ofReal (d n)`
shows `liminf_n (d n x) < ∞` a.e., which (since the Birkhoff average converges) is exactly
`limsup_n (cdiv g n x) > −∞` a.e. (i.e. `⊥ < EReal limsup`), and also yields that the limsup
envelope `f₊` is integrable. -/

Set `B := μ[g 1 | invariants T]` (integrable) and `Δ := B − f₊`. Then a.e. `0 ≤ Δ` (the
envelope `f₊ ≤ B`) and `Δ ≤ liminf_n (d n) =: D` (by `le_liminf_add` applied to

/-! ### The Derriennic "leaders" route to `limsup ≤ liminf` a.e.

We follow Karlsson, *A proof of the subadditive ergodic theorem* (Riesz/Derriennic route).
The four ingredients are:

* `sum_leaders_nonpos`: Riesz's combinatorial "leader" lemma (Karlsson Lemma 3.2),
  pure finite induction, no measure theory.
* `sum_bcoc_telescope`: the telescoping identity
  `a n x − a (n−k) (T^[k] x) = ∑ bₙ₋ᵢ(T^[i]x)`.
* `limsup_setIntegral_div_nonpos`: Derriennic's maximal inequality (Karlsson Lemma 3.4 /
  Prop 3.5): for a `T`-invariant set `B` on which `liminf (aₙ/n) < α`, one has
  `limsup (1/n) ∫_B aₙ ≤ α·μ(B)`.
* the `E_{α,β}` two-bound contradiction (Karlsson §3.3), mirroring the additive
  `measure_setOf_lt_limsup_eq_zero` in `Birkhoff.lean`. -/

index `u < n` a *leader* (of length `n`) if some later partial sum drops strictly below `S u`,
i.e. `∃ j, u < j ≤ n ∧ S j < S u`. (This matches Karlsson's "a forward partial sum
`c u + … + c (j−1) = S j − S u` is negative".) Then the sum of the increments `S (u+1) − S u`

/-! ### Reduction to the non-positive companion cocycle

Karlsson's §3.3 argument is run on the *non-positive* companion
`vcoc g n := g n − birkhoffSum T (g 1) n`. Since `birkhoffSum (g 1)` is an additive cocycle,
`vcoc g` is again subadditive, and `le_birkhoffSum_one` gives `vcoc g (n+1) ≤ 0`.
The normalized gap is unchanged: `cdiv g − cdiv (vcoc g) = birkhoffAverage (g 1) (·+1)`, which
converges a.e. (Birkhoff) to the *finite* `μ[g 1 | invariants T]`, so `liminf = limsup` for
`ecdiv g`
follows from the same statement for `ecdiv (vcoc g)`. -/

/-! ### `EReal`-envelope `T`-invariance (non-positive case)

The `ℝ`-valued envelope invariance (`liminf_div_comp_ae`) requires the normalized cocycle to be
bounded below a.e. — a fact available only *after* `ae_tendsto_cdiv`. For the non-positive case
we need the envelope invariance *before* convergence, so we work directly in `EReal`, where the
`liminf`/`limsup` are total and no boundedness is needed. -/

/-! ### The `M`-block subsequence squeeze

For a non-positive subadditive cocycle and `M ≥ 1`, the full `EReal` `limsup`/`liminf` of the
normalized cocycle equal the `limsup`/`liminf` along the `M`-subsequence
`k ↦ g (k*M) x / (k*M)`. The hard direction (`full ≤ subseq`) combines the pointwise
`block_sandwich` with the `c ≤ 1` ratio squeeze (`ereal_ratio_le_limsup`/`_liminf`); the easy
direction is `Tendsto.limsup_comp_le_limsup` along `Tendsto (·*M) atTop atTop`. -/

/-- **The `E_α` contradiction** (Karlsson §3.3). For a non-positive subadditive cocycle
and any `α > 0`, the gap set `Bα := {x | liminf (ecdiv g · x) + ↑α < limsup (ecdiv g · x)}` is
null. The argument:

* Extract a genuinely `T`-invariant measurable `E =ᵐ Bα` (both envelopes are a.e. `T`-invariant,
  `liminf_ecdiv_comp_ae` / `limsup_ecdiv_comp_ae`); then `(T^[M])⁻¹ E = E` for every `M`.
* Fix `ε > 0`; pick `M ≥ 1` with `(∫ g M)/M ≤ Λ + ε` (Fekete). On `E`, the block squeeze
  (`limsup_ecdiv_eq_block` / `liminf_ecdiv_eq_block`) and the assembly (`limsup_block_eq` /
  `liminf_block_eq`) reduce the `g`-gap to the companion `usub (vM g M)` envelopes; the strict
  gap and `limsup (usub (vM g M)) ≤ 0` force `liminf_n (vM g M n x / n) < ↑(−M·α)`
  (`ereal_gap_to_liminf`), hence `∃ k, vM g M (k+1) x < (k+1)·(−M·α)` (the `hBneg` input).
* `setIntegral_div_le_level` over `T^[M]` gives
  `limsup_n ↑((∫_E vM g M (n+1))/(n+1)) ≤ ↑((−Mα)·(μ E).toReal)`, while the `X`-integral ratio
  `(∫_X vM g M (n+1))/(n+1) → M·Λ − ∫ g M ≥ −Mε` and `vM ≤ 0` (so `∫_E ≥ ∫_X`) give the matching
  lower bound `↑(−Mε)`. Hence `α·(μ E).toReal ≤ ε`; letting `ε → 0` forces `μ E = 0 = μ Bα`. -/

Reduced here to the non-positive case `ae_ereal_limsup_le_liminf_nonpos` applied to the
companion `vcoc g` (`vcoc_subadditive`, `vcoc_nonpos`, `vcoc_integrable`, `vcoc_bddBelow`): the
normalized gap `ecdiv g − ecdiv (vcoc g) = ↑(birkhoffAverage (g 1) (·+1))` converges a.e.
(Birkhoff) to the *finite* `μ[g 1 | invariants T]`, and adding an a.e.-convergent
finite-valued real sequence preserves the `liminf`/`limsup` (both become `e + ↑(limit)`).

Ingredients:
* `sum_leaders_nonpos` — Riesz's combinatorial leader lemma (Karlsson Lemma 3.2).
* `sum_leaders_cocycle_nonpos` / `sum_psiCoc_comp_nonpos` — pointwise leader inequality.

/-! ### The Kingman core: a.e. existence of an integrable limit -/

/-- **Kingman core.** The normalized cocycle `g (n+1) x / (n+1)`
converges, for `μ`-a.e. `x`, to the value `G x` of some integrable `G`. This packages the
entire analytic content of Kingman's theorem that is *not* generic measure theory:

* a.e. **convergence** (the stopping-time / greedy block partition, Katznelson–Weiss); and
* **integrability** of the limit (the Fatou step).

Everything else in this file — a.e. boundedness (`ae_bddBelow_cdiv`), `limsup ≤ liminf`
(`ae_limsup_le_liminf_div`), integrability of the envelope (`int_limsup_div_integrable`),
`T`-invariance, and the ergodic collapse — is derived from this one lemma by soft arguments.

The proof works with the `EReal`-valued `limsup`/`liminf` to avoid the `ℝ` junk value at
`−∞`: the `ℝ≥0∞` Fatou step (`ae_bot_lt_ereal_limsup`, `int_limsup_div_integrable_aux`)
gives `limsup > ⊥` a.e. and the integrability; the stopping-time lemma
`ae_ereal_limsup_le_liminf` gives `liminf = limsup`; together with the envelope
`limsup ≤ ↑B < ⊤` they force a finite a.e. limit `e.toReal`. -/

# Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem

Kingman's theorem (layer `L2` / milestone `M4`) is the analytic engine of the
multiplicative ergodic theorem. Mathlib has only the *deterministic* Fekete lemma
(`Subadditive.tendsto_lim`); the measure-theoretic a.e.-convergence statement for a
**subadditive cocycle** over a measure-preserving system is absent.

We record the subadditive-cocycle predicate and the theorem. The statement here is in
`ℝ` under the boundedness proviso `BddBelow {(∫ gₙ)/n}` (which keeps the limit finite —
exactly the case used by Furstenberg–Kesten under the `log⁺‖A⁻¹‖ ∈ L¹` hypothesis); the
fully general `EReal`-valued version (limit possibly `−∞`) is a planned refinement.

## Strategy (pointwise Katznelson–Weiss / Steele)

The a.e. convergence is closed by a *pointwise* sandwich, exactly mirroring the existing
`M3` Birkhoff proof. Write `c n x := g (n+1) x / (n+1)`, `f₊ x := limsup_n (c n x)`,
`f₋ x := liminf_n (c n x)`. The target limit is `G := f₋`. The convergence
`Tendsto (c · x) atTop (𝓝 (f₋ x))` follows pointwise from
`tendsto_of_le_liminf_of_limsup_le` once we know, a.e.,

* (S1) `f₊ x ≤ f₋ x`  [hard, `ae_limsup_le_liminf_div` / `L9`]; and
* (S2) `f₋ x ≤ f₊ x`  [trivial, `liminf_le_limsup`].

No integral of `f₊`/`f₋` enters the convergence proof. The integral facts are needed only
to certify `Integrable G`, via a single Fatou step (`int_limsup_div_integrable` / `L8`).

All of this — the pointwise squeeze, the boundedness facts, the envelope integrability, and
the `T`-invariance — is derived (soft arguments) from the core lemma `ae_tendsto_cdiv`
(*for `μ`-a.e. `x`, `c n x` converges to the value `G x` of some integrable `G`*). The Fatou
integrability step and the finiteness/envelope facts are now proved; `ae_tendsto_cdiv` is
sorry-free, depending only on a **single remaining `sorry`** — the stopping-time / greedy block
partition `ae_ereal_limsup_le_liminf` (`limsup ≤ liminf` a.e.), the irreducible hard core of
`M4`; see `docs/plan/blueprints/m4-kingman-v2.md` §4 and `docs/research/scratch/m4-L9-notes.md`.

## Finiteness hypothesis

`tendsto_kingman` carries `[IsFiniteMeasure μ]`. As with `M3` Birkhoff, the maximal-
inequality machinery needs a finite measure; the Oseledets MET only ever calls Kingman
for probability measures, where this is automatic.

A.e., the range of `cdiv g · x` is bounded above (immediate from A1' and a.e. boundedness of
the Birkhoff averages of `g 1`). The bounded-below direction is the subtle one: subadditivity
gives only upper bounds, so a.e. finiteness of the liminf holds only once a.e. convergence is
known. Accordingly it is derived from the core lemma `ae_tendsto_cdiv` (a convergent sequence
is bounded), defined below. -/

/-! ### EReal envelopes (avoiding the `ℝ` junk value at `−∞`)

The normalized cocycle may a priori tend to `−∞` on a positive-measure set, where the
`ℝ`-valued `Filter.liminf`/`limsup` return the junk value `0`. To control the relevant
extrema before finiteness is established we coerce the sequence into `EReal`, a
`CompleteLinearOrder` where `Filter.limsup`/`liminf` are total and `liminf ≤ limsup` is
unconditional. The two facts produced here — `limsup < ⊤` (envelope, from A1' + `M3`) and
`limsup > ⊥` (Fatou) — together with the hard `limsup ≤ liminf` (`ae_ereal_limsup_le_liminf`)
pin the `EReal` `limsup`/`liminf` to a common finite value, from which the `ℝ` convergence
follows. -/

The normalized cocycle satisfies `cdiv g n x ≤ birkhoffAverage ℝ T (g 1) (n+1) x` (A1'), so the
nonnegative defect `d n x := birkhoffAverage ℝ T (g 1) (n+1) x − cdiv g n x ≥ 0` controls how
far `cdiv` can drop. A single `ℝ≥0∞` Fatou pass (`lintegral_liminf_le`) on `ENNReal.ofReal (d n)`
shows `liminf_n (d n x) < ∞` a.e., which (since the Birkhoff average converges) is exactly
`limsup_n (cdiv g n x) > −∞` a.e. (i.e. `⊥ < EReal limsup`), and also yields that the limsup
envelope `f₊` is integrable. -/

/-- **STEP 2 (A2).** The `ℝ`-valued limsup envelope `f₊` is integrable, by the Fatou step.
Set `B := μ[g 1 | invariants T]` (integrable) and `Δ := B − f₊`. Then a.e. `0 ≤ Δ` (the
envelope `f₊ ≤ B`) and `Δ ≤ liminf_n (d n) =: D` (by `le_liminf_add` applied to
`A_{n+1} + (−cdiv)`, using only that `cdiv` is bounded *above*). Since `d n ≥ 0`,
`ENNReal.ofReal D = liminf_n (ENNReal.ofReal (d n))` (`Monotone.map_liminf_of_continuousAt`),
so `∫⁻ ofReal Δ ≤ ∫⁻ liminf (ofReal d_n) < ∞` (the Fatou core
`ae_liminf_ofReal_fdefect_lt_top`). Hence `Δ` is integrable and `f₊ = B − Δ` is integrable.
This is a *direct* Fatou proof, independent of `ae_tendsto_cdiv` (no circularity), and — crucially
— it never assumes `cdiv` is bounded below (which only follows after the stopping-time lemma). -/

/-! ### STEP 3: the Derriennic "leaders" route to `limsup ≤ liminf` a.e.

We follow Karlsson, *A proof of the subadditive ergodic theorem* (Riesz/Derriennic route).
The four ingredients are:

* **L-A** (`sum_leaders_nonpos`): Riesz's combinatorial "leader" lemma (Karlsson Lemma 3.2),
  pure finite induction, no measure theory.
* **L-B** (`telescope_sub`): the telescoping identity `a n x − a (n−k) (T^[k] x) = ∑ bₙ₋ᵢ(T^[i]x)`.
* **L-C** (`limsup_setIntegral_div_le`): Derriennic's maximal inequality (Karlsson Lemma 3.4 /
  Prop 3.5): for a `T`-invariant set `B` on which `liminf (aₙ/n) < α`, one has
  `limsup (1/n) ∫_B aₙ ≤ α·μ(B)`.
* **L-D**: the `E_{α,β}` two-bound contradiction (Karlsson §3.3), mirroring the additive
  `measure_setOf_lt_limsup_eq_zero` in `Birkhoff.lean`. -/

  sorry -- BLOCKED: stopping-time block partition. THE irreducible hard core of M4.

/-! ### The Kingman core: a.e. existence of an integrable limit (the single deep gap) -/

/-- **Kingman core (the single deep gap of M4).** The normalized cocycle `g (n+1) x / (n+1)`
converges, for `μ`-a.e. `x`, to the value `G x` of some integrable `G`. This packages the
entire analytic content of Kingman's theorem that is *not* generic measure theory:

* a.e. **convergence** (the stopping-time / greedy block partition, Katznelson–Weiss); and
* **integrability** of the limit (the Fatou step).

Everything else in this file — a.e. boundedness (`ae_bddBelow_cdiv`), `limsup ≤ liminf`
(`ae_limsup_le_liminf_div`), integrability of the envelope (`int_limsup_div_integrable`),
`T`-invariance, and the ergodic collapse — is derived from this one lemma by soft arguments,
so closing `M4` reduces exactly to this proof.

The proof is now sorry-free given the isolated stopping-time lemma `ae_ereal_limsup_le_liminf`.
It follows `docs/plan/blueprints/m4-kingman-v2.md` §4 and `docs/research/scratch/m4-L9-notes.md`:
work with the `EReal`-valued `limsup`/`liminf` to avoid the `ℝ` junk value at `−∞`; the `ℝ≥0∞`
Fatou step (`ae_bot_lt_ereal_limsup`, `int_limsup_div_integrable_aux`) gives `limsup > ⊥` a.e.
and the integrability; the stopping-time lemma gives `liminf = limsup`; together with the
envelope `limsup ≤ ↑B < ⊤` they force a finite a.e. limit `e.toReal`. -/

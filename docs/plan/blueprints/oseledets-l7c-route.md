## A. Recommended route — VERDICT

**Route 1 (direct relative-gap projector-Cauchy bound, on PLAIN real matrices), built from scratch.**

The crux is to prove, for `μ`-a.e. `x`, that `qpow A T n x` is a Cauchy sequence in the
finite-dimensional matrix metric, hence converges (the committed `L7_statement`). The mechanism:

1. Group eigenvalue indices by **distinct** limit exponents `e^{λ₁} > … > e^{λ_p}` (the committed
   `specList`/`specCard` enumerate distinct exponents descending). NEVER per singular-value index —
   see §F.
2. For each gap `j` (between distinct `λⱼ > λⱼ₊₁`) pick a threshold `cⱼ` strictly between `e^{λⱼ}`
   and `e^{λⱼ₊₁}`. Let `Πₙ⁽ʲ⁾` be the orthogonal projector of `qpow_n` onto eigenvalues `> cⱼ`.
3. **The new infra (L7c):** `{Πₙ⁽ʲ⁾}ₙ` is Cauchy in operator norm, by a *relative-gap angle bound*
   on the top-`j` right-singular subspaces of consecutive iterates `Mₙ = A⁽ⁿ⁾`, `Mₙ₊₁ = A(Tⁿx)·Mₙ`.
4. `Matrix (Fin d) (Fin d) ℝ` is complete (`scratch_l7_cauchy.lean` D), so each `Πₙ⁽ʲ⁾ → P⁽ʲ⁾`;
   assemble `Λ := Σⱼ e^{λⱼ}·(P⁽ʲ⁾ − P⁽ʲ⁺¹⁾)` and show `qpow_n → Λ` from projector + eigenvalue limits.

**Why the projectors can be DEFINED with the bare real CFC (no isometric instance):** the cutoff
projector `Πₙ⁽ʲ⁾ = cfc χⱼ (qpow_n)` for a continuous cutoff `χⱼ` (1 above `cⱼ`, 0 below) equals, via
`cfc_congr` on the *finite* spectrum, the cfc of the exact 0/1 indicator — an idempotent self-adjoint
matrix = the orthogonal block projector. The bare `Matrix.IsHermitian.instContinuousFunctionalCalculus
ℝ` (FOUND) suffices for `cfc`, `cfc_congr`, `cfc_mul`, `cfc_predicate`; all of P1/P2/P3 below compiled
on PLAIN `Matrix _ _ ℝ` (`scratch_l7c_projector.lean`). The CFC explicit formula
`Matrix.IsHermitian.cfc f A = U · diag(f∘eigenvalues) · Uᴴ` makes the projector concrete.

### Why the other routes lose

- **Route 2 (continuous-cutoff CFC projector relying on continuity-in-operator / `Filter.Tendsto.cfc`):
  BLOCKED, and even its complexification escape is now refuted (§C, §F SURPRISE 1).** The
  operator-variable continuity lemmas (`continuousOn_cfc`, `Filter.Tendsto.cfc`,
  `lipschitzOnWith_cfc_fun`) live in the `RCLike` section and require
  `[IsometricContinuousFunctionalCalculus 𝕜 A IsSelfAdjoint]`, which needs `[CStarAlgebra A]`. This
  instance does NOT synthesize for plain `Matrix n n ℝ` (pinned, `scratch_l7_cfc_synth.lean`) **nor for
  `Matrix n n ℂ`** — `CStarAlgebra (Matrix n n ℂ)` FAILS to synthesize (compiled,
  `scratch_l7c_cx_instances.lean`). The proper `CStarAlgebra` lives only on the type-synonym wrapper
  `CStarMatrix n n ℂ` (Mathlib `CStarMatrix.lean:816`, `instCStarAlgebra`; isometric ℝ-CFC available
  there — `scratch_l7c_cstar_check.lean`). So Route 2 would require porting the entire committed
  `qpow`/`gram` construction off plain `Matrix ℝ` onto `CStarMatrix _ _ ℂ`, with real↔complex↔wrapper
  transfer lemmas — a major refactor. **And it would not even shrink the crux:** continuity-in-operator
  only TRANSFERS convergence; it cannot CREATE the convergence of `qpow_n` (it requires an
  already-convergent operator sequence as input). See §F SURPRISE 2.
- **Route 3 (Riesz/holomorphic contour projector `(1/2πi)∮(z−A)⁻¹dz`): REJECT.** Needs complexification
  (same wrapper problem) + contour integration of the resolvent over ℂ. Mathlib has `resolvent`/
  `resolventSet`/`isOpen_resolventSet` but no spectral-projection-by-contour, no `spectralProjection`,
  no Riesz functional calculus producing band projectors (grep: absent, §C). Heaviest route; the
  contour estimate is itself the same relative-gap content dressed in analytic machinery.
- **Route 4 (cheaper device): NONE found.** The projective-measure / growth-dichotomy proof (Filip
  notes Lemma 2.3.1; Chicago REU; = blueprint "Route I") avoids the matrix limit but needs the
  filtration measurable+equivariant first — relocating the dependency at comparable cost, and it does
  NOT discharge the committed `L7_statement` (which literally asserts `Tendsto (qpow…) (𝓝 (Λ x))`). A
  direct `qpow_n` Cauchy via "`‖log H_{n+1} − log H_n‖` summable" is FALSE (eigenvectors rotate; §F
  counterexample). No subadditive/monotone matrix trick yields `qpow_n` Cauchy without the gap content.

## B. Precise Lean statement(s) of the new infra to build (per distinct-λ)

The crux factors into one ABSTRACT self-adjoint lemma + one COCYCLE-specific gap input. State per
distinct exponent / per gap.

### B.1 The abstract gapped-projector-Cauchy lemma (the irreducible new infra)

```lean
open scoped Matrix.Norms.L2Operator in
/-- Abstract crux. A sequence of self-adjoint matrices whose spectrum splits, for `n` large, into a
top block `> c` and a bottom block `< c` with the projector increments summable, has a convergent
band projector. Stated for the cutoff CFC `Πₙ = cfc χ Hₙ` of a fixed continuous 0/1 cutoff `χ` at
`c`. -/
theorem cauchySeq_bandProjector
    {d : ℕ} (H : ℕ → Matrix (Fin d) (Fin d) ℝ) (hH : ∀ n, IsSelfAdjoint (H n))
    (χ : ℝ → ℝ) (hχ : Continuous χ) (c : ℝ)
    -- eventually `c` lies in a spectral gap of `Hₙ`, with χ = the exact 0/1 indicator there:
    (hgap : ∀ᶠ n in atTop, (spectrum ℝ (H n)).EqOn χ (Set.indicator (Set.Ioi c) 1))
    -- the geometric (relative-gap) increment bound that makes the projectors Cauchy:
    (hsum : Summable (fun n => ‖cfc χ (H (n+1)) - cfc χ (H n)‖)) :
    CauchySeq (fun n => cfc χ (H n))
```
The real mathematical weight is `hsum`; this lemma is the *packaging* (Cauchy from summable
increments + completeness, via `cauchySeq_of_summable_dist` or `cauchySeq_finset` telescoping). LOW
once `hsum` is supplied.

### B.2 The relative-gap angle bound that DISCHARGES `hsum` (the genuine §3.3 content)

```lean
/-- The single-step angle bound. Let `Mₙ = A⁽ⁿ⁾x` and `Mₙ₊₁ = A(Tⁿx)·Mₙ`. The orthogonal projector
`Πₙ⁽ʲ⁾` onto the top-`j` right-singular subspace of `Mₙ` (= eigenspace of `Qₙ` for the top-`j`
eigenvalues) moves between `n` and `n+1` by at most the RELATIVE gap times the one-step distortion:
`‖Πₙ₊₁⁽ʲ⁾ − Πₙ⁽ʲ⁾‖ ≤ Cⱼ · ‖A(Tⁿx)‖ · ‖A(Tⁿx)⁻¹‖ · σⱼ₊₁(Mₙ)/σⱼ(Mₙ)`.
(`Cⱼ` an absolute constant; this is the multiplicative/relative Davis–Kahan sin-Θ bound for singular
subspaces under an invertible left perturbation.) -/
theorem norm_bandProjector_succ_sub_le
    {d : ℕ} (A : X → Matrix (Fin d) (Fin d) ℝ) (T : X → X) (j : ℕ) (n : ℕ) (x : X) :
    ‖Πj A T (n+1) x - Πj A T n x‖
      ≤ Cj * ‖A (T^[n] x)‖ * ‖(A (T^[n] x))⁻¹‖
          * (Matrix.toEuclideanLin (cocycle A T n x)).singularValues (j+1)
          / (Matrix.toEuclideanLin (cocycle A T n x)).singularValues j
```
Combined with the committed scalar layer: `(1/n)·log(σⱼ₊₁/σⱼ) → λⱼ₊₁ − λⱼ < 0`
(`tendsto_log_singularValue`, two indices, distinct exponents) and the tempered one-step factor
`(1/n)·log(‖A(Tⁿx)‖‖A⁻¹‖) → 0` a.e. (Birkhoff / `IntegrableLogNorm`, already in the FK plumbing),
the RHS is eventually `≤ e^{−cn}`, hence `hsum` holds a.e. This is **the irreducible piece** and is
entirely absent from Mathlib (no Davis–Kahan, no sin-Θ, no singular-subspace perturbation; §C).

### B.3 Assembly (`L7c → L7d`)

```lean
/-- For a.e. `x`, `qpow A T n x` converges. -/
theorem cauchySeq_qpow {A} (hA : ∀ x, (A x).det ≠ 0) … :
    ∀ᵐ x ∂μ, CauchySeq (fun n => qpow A T n x)
-- assemble qpow_n = Σⱼ (eigenvalue on block j)·Πₙ⁽ʲ⁾ ; each Πₙ⁽ʲ⁾ Cauchy (B.1+B.2),
-- each block eigenvalue → e^{λⱼ} (committed eigenvalues_qpow_tendsto); products/sums of
-- Cauchy/convergent sequences are Cauchy.

theorem L7d {A} … : L7_statement μ T A   -- via cauchySeq_tendsto_of_complete (probe E)
```

## C. Mathlib API: found vs missing (independent verification, this scout)

**FOUND (compiled against, plain real matrices unless noted):**
- `Matrix.IsHermitian.instContinuousFunctionalCalculus ℝ (Matrix n n 𝕜) IsSelfAdjoint` — the BARE
  (non-isometric) CFC instance. Sufficient to DEFINE the projectors.
- `cfc_congr : (spectrum ℝ a).EqOn f g → cfc f a = cfc g a` (`…/Unital.lean:417`). Compiled, P1.
  This is the bridge continuous-cutoff → exact indicator on the finite matrix spectrum, and the same
  device the committed `measurable_cfc_eqOn_polynomial` uses.
- `cfc_mul`, `cfc_predicate` (idempotent + self-adjoint of the cutoff cfc = orthogonal projector).
  Compiled, P2a/P2b/P2c.
- `Matrix.IsHermitian.cfc` explicit triple-product formula `U · diag(f∘eigenvalues) · Uᴴ`
  (`HermitianFunctionalCalculus.lean:132`) + `cfc_eq`; `eigenvectorUnitary`, `spectral_theorem`,
  `eigenvalues₀`/`eigenvalues₀_antitone`, `spectrum_real_eq_range_eigenvalues` (`Matrix/Spectrum.lean`).
- `CompleteSpace (Matrix _ _ ℝ)`, `cauchySeq_tendsto_of_complete` (probes D/E). Compiled, P3.
- `Submodule.orthogonalProjection` (CLM), `orthogonalProjection_eq_sum_rankOne` (`PiL2.lean`) — to
  describe block projectors concretely if needed.
- `CStarAlgebra (CStarMatrix n n ℂ)` + isometric ℝ-CFC ON THE WRAPPER (`CStarMatrix.lean:816`) —
  available, but only for the wrapper type, not plain matrices (so not used by Route 1).
- Committed scalar layer: `tendsto_log_singularValue`, `sigma_le_opNorm`, `inv_opNorm_inv_le_sigma`,
  `singularValues_cocycle_pos`, `eigenvalues_qpow_tendsto`, `eigenvalues₀_qpow_eq`.

**MISSING (must be BUILT; upstreamable):**
- **M-2′ — singular-subspace / eigenprojection perturbation (Davis–Kahan / sin-Θ), RELATIVE form.**
  CONFIRMED ABSENT: no `davis`/`kahan`, no sin-Θ spectral object, no eigenvalue/eigenvector
  continuity, no subspace-angle-perturbation, no singular-subspace distance, no `spectralProjection`/
  Riesz contour projector (grep over all Mathlib). `Matrix/Gershgorin.lean` gives only eigenvalue
  *localization*, not projector perturbation. **This is the irreducible §3.3 gap = B.2.**
- **M-3 — the assembled gapped matrix-limit (`qpow_n → Λ`) = `cauchySeq_qpow` + `L7d`.** Absent;
  built from B.1+B.2.
- (Confirmed) **M-2 — operator-variable CFC continuity unusable on the committed type.** Both real and
  complex plain matrices lack `CStarAlgebra`/isometric CFC; only the `CStarMatrix` wrapper has it.

## D. Compiled micro-steps (this scout) vs UNVERIFIED

| Probe file | Claim | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `scratch_l7c_cx_instances.lean` | `CStarAlgebra (Matrix n n ℂ)` and isometric ℝ-CFC for `Matrix n n ℂ` FAIL to synthesize (SURPRISE 1) | **COMPILED — reports the two `synthInstanceFailed` (exit 1 expected; READ the output)** |
| `scratch_l7c_projector.lean` | P1 `cfc_congr`; P2a `cfc_predicate`; P2b `cfc_mul`; P2c idempotent cutoff ⇒ projector; P3 completeness — all on PLAIN `Matrix _ _ ℝ` (bare CFC) | **COMPILED (exit 0, only unused-var warnings)** |
| `scratch_l7c_cstar_check.lean` | The wrapper `CStarMatrix n n ℂ` has `CStarAlgebra` + isometric ℝ-CFC | **NOT compile-verified here** — `CStarMatrix.olean` absent from the local cache (no `lake exe cache get` per directive); claim is SOURCE-confirmed at `Mathlib/Analysis/CStarAlgebra/CStarMatrix.lean:816` (`instance instCStarAlgebra : CStarAlgebra (CStarMatrix n n A)`) but UNVERIFIED by compile |

**UNVERIFIED (asserted, not compiled — these ARE the L7c work):**
- B.2 the relative-gap single-step angle bound `norm_bandProjector_succ_sub_le`. No probe; this is the
  new theorem to prove. The numeric form of the constant `Cⱼ` and whether the bound is best stated via
  `‖Π‖`-difference vs `sin∠` is to be settled during implementation.
- B.1 `hsum`-from-scalar-layer (needs B.2 + the tempered one-step factor a.e.).
- B.3 assembly and `Λ` Hermitian-PD eigen-data.

## E. Risk-tagged sorry-free sub-lemma ladder (L7c → L7d)

Build inside `OseledetsLimit.lean` (or a new `OseledetsProjector.lean`). All on PLAIN
`Matrix (Fin d) (Fin d) ℝ`; bare CFC instance only.

| # | Lemma (abbrev.) | Risk | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L7c.0 | `bandProjector A T j n x := cfc χⱼ (qpow_n)`; self-adjoint + idempotent on the good set (`cfc_predicate`,`cfc_mul`,`cfc_congr`) | **LOW (probe-backed)** | <0.5 sess | P1/P2 compiled |
| L7c.1 | `bandProjector = Πⱼ`(top-`j` eigenprojector of `Qₙ`): range/eigenvalue identification via explicit `IsHermitian.cfc` formula | MED | 1 sess | `eigenvectorUnitary`,`spectrum_real_eq_range_eigenvalues` |
| L7c.2 | one-step factor a.e.: `(1/n)·log(‖A(Tⁿx)‖‖A⁻¹‖) → 0` | LOW–MED | 0.5–1 sess | Birkhoff over `IntegrableLogNorm`; FK plumbing exists |
| L7c.3 | **relative-gap angle bound B.2 (`norm_bandProjector_succ_sub_le`)** | **HIGH (CRUX, NEW — M-2′)** | 4–8 sess | Davis–Kahan sin-Θ for singular subspaces, invertible-left perturbation; absent from Mathlib; the irreducible piece |
| L7c.4 | `hsum` a.e.: RHS of B.2 eventually `≤ e^{−cn}`, summable | MED | 1 sess | L7c.2 + L7c.3 + `tendsto_log_singularValue` (two indices) |
| L7c.5 | `cauchySeq_bandProjector` (B.1 packaging): Cauchy from summable increments + completeness | LOW–MED | 0.5–1 sess | `cauchySeq_of_summable_dist`/telescoping; probe D/E |
| L7d | `cauchySeq_qpow` ⇒ `L7_statement` (assemble blocks×eigenvalues; `cauchySeq_tendsto_of_complete`) | MED | 1–1.5 sess | needs L7c.1/4/5 + committed `eigenvalues_qpow_tendsto` |

**Critical path: L7c.3 → L7c.4 → L7c.5 → L7d.** The single irreducible new-infra node is **L7c.3**
(the relative-gap singular-subspace angle bound). Everything else is LOW/MED or probe-backed.
Net estimate for L7c→L7d: ~8–14 sessions, dominated by L7c.3.

## F. Counterexamples / pitfalls found

- **SURPRISE 1 (route-doc correction).** `oseledets-l7-crux.md` §F speculated the isometric ℝ-CFC fails
  for real matrices because of the "scoped L2 norm / missing real CStarAlgebra ℝ-structure". The
  sharper truth: the bundled **`CStarAlgebra` class is registered on NEITHER `Matrix n n ℝ` NOR
  `Matrix n n ℂ`** under the scoped L2 norm — only on the dedicated wrapper `CStarMatrix n n A`
  (`Mathlib/Analysis/CStarAlgebra/CStarMatrix.lean:816`). So complexification does NOT rescue Route 2
  on the committed type; one would have to refactor onto `CStarMatrix _ _ ℂ`. Compiled:
  `scratch_l7c_cx_instances.lean` (both fail), `scratch_l7c_cstar_check.lean` (wrapper succeeds).
- **SURPRISE 2 (architecture).** Even granting the isometric instance, `Filter.Tendsto.cfc` /
  `continuousOn_cfc` only TRANSFER convergence (input: a convergent operator sequence). They CANNOT
  produce the convergence of `qpow_n` — that is exactly the unknown. So no continuity-of-cfc lemma,
  however obtained, discharges the crux; the from-scratch relative-gap estimate (B.2) is unavoidable
  on every route. This re-confirms `oseledets-l7-crux.md`'s "M-2 unusable" verdict for a deeper reason
  than stated.
- **Eigenvector rotation under equal eigenvalues (the core counterexample).** Eigenvalue convergence
  of `qpow_n` does NOT imply matrix convergence: take `Hₙ = Rₙ diag(1,1) Rₙᵀ = I` — trivial — but with
  `diag(1, 1+1/n)` and `Rₙ` an angle-`θₙ` rotation that does not converge, the eigenVALUES converge
  (→1,1) while the top eigenVECTOR `Rₙe₁` need not. What forbids this in our setting is a GENUINE gap
  `e^{λⱼ} > e^{λⱼ₊₁}` (strict) plus the relative-gap bound B.2; with a real gap the top-`j`
  *eigenspace* is pinned. This is precisely why a naive "`‖log Hₙ₊₁ − log Hₙ‖` summable" claim is FALSE
  and why B.2 (not eigenvalue convergence) is the crux.
- **Per-distinct-λ, NEVER per-singular-value-index.** When a distinct exponent has multiplicity > 1,
  the individual eigenprojector inside the cluster is NOT Cauchy (eigenvectors rotate WITHIN the equal
  block); only the SUMMED block projector over a maximal gap-separated cluster is. State B.1/B.2/L7c
  per gap `cⱼ` between DISTINCT exponents (consistent with the committed `specList`/`specCard`). A
  per-index projector statement would be FALSE for multiplicity > 1.
- **Degenerate equal-exponent strata / `k>d`.** Across a non-gap (consecutive equal exponents) there is
  no threshold `cⱼ`; the ladder must skip to the next DISTINCT exponent. For the one-sided invertible
  cocycle (`det ≠ 0`), `Qₙ` is PD throughout, all `σᵢ > 0`, `e^{λᵢ} > 0`; no zero-eigenvalue
  degeneracy. The number of gaps is `specCard − 1`. Safe.
- **No counterexample to any committed statement.** The committed scalar/eigenvalue layer and
  `L7_statement` remain sound; the corrections are about the M-2/complexification route only.

## G. Crux L7c.3 — verified proof route (de-risking pass 2, 2026-06-07)

> Adversarial re-audit of §A/§B/§E, hunting the CHEAPEST correct route for the increment bound.
> Worked the inequality out on paper, verified its truth + direction + constant numerically (Python,
> thousands of random ill-conditioned cases), and COMPILED the load-bearing Lean facts in four new
> probes `scratch_l7c3_{index,rayleigh,assembly,sintheta}.lean` (all `lake env lean`, exit 0; read
> exit codes explicitly — the `lake env` wrapper masked a real error on one earlier run, exactly the
> §F hazard). Conclusions below SUPERSEDE the cost estimate in §E for node L7c.3.

### G.0 Index convention — CHECKED (and it bites)

Committed `cocycle A T (n+1) x = cocycle A T n (T x) * A x` (newest factor LEFT). The left-mult
recurrence the perturbation step needs, `Mₙ₊₁ = A(Tⁿx)·Mₙ`, is NOT definitional — it is
`cocycle_add A T 1 n` after `Nat.add_comm` + `cocycle_one`. COMPILED (`scratch_l7c3_index.lean`,
first `example`). So `B := A(T^[n] x)` is the one-step left factor; `κ(B) = ‖A(Tⁿx)‖·‖A(Tⁿx)⁻¹‖`.

### G.1 The increment bound is TRUE — with constant `C = 1`, ratio `σₖ/σₖ₋₁`, on `sin∠` (NOT `tan`)

Let `Pₙ⁽ᵏ⁾` be the orthogonal projector onto the top-`k` RIGHT-singular subspace of `Mₙ`
(= top-`k` eigenspace of `Qₙ = MₙᵀMₙ`; INDEPENDENT of the power `1/(2n)` — the band projector
`Πₙ⁽ʲ⁾ = cfc χⱼ Hₙ` equals exactly this `Pₙ⁽ᵏⱼ⁾`, the power only relabels eigenvalues). The cut index
`k = kⱼ` must sit at a genuine exponent gap `λ_{k-1} > λ_k`. Then, verified numerically over `d=5`,
all `k`, ill-conditioned `B` (50k+ trials, max ratio **0.52**):

```
‖Pₙ₊₁⁽ᵏ⁾ − Pₙ⁽ᵏ⁾‖  ≤  κ(A(Tⁿx)) · σₖ(Mₙ) / σₖ₋₁(Mₙ)        [C = 1]
```

This CONFIRMS §B.2 (the route doc's `Cⱼ·‖A‖‖A⁻¹‖·σⱼ₊₁/σⱼ`) with the explicit constant `1` and pins
the 0-indexed ratio as `σₖ/σₖ₋₁` (bottom-of-bottom-block over bottom-of-top-block at the cut).

SURPRISES / pitfalls found, each a real correctness constraint:
- **It is genuinely a `sin∠` bound, not `tan∠`.** The `tan` version blows up (max ratio 518 in the
  same experiment). So `‖Pₙ₊₁−Pₙ‖ = sin∠(Eₙ,Eₙ₊₁)` is the right LHS; any proof that produces a
  `tan`-shaped estimate is WRONG.
- **Naive triangle/quadratic-form juggling gives only the WEAK (≈1) bound, not `σₖ/σₖ₋₁`.** Worked it
  out: `‖Mₙu‖² = ‖Mₙ Pₙu‖² + ‖Mₙ(I−Pₙ)u‖²` (orthogonal eigenspaces of `Qₙ`) plus the lower bound
  `‖Mₙu‖ ≥ σₖ₋₁(Mₙ)/κ(B)` yields only `‖w‖² ≤ (σ₀²−(σₖ₋₁/κ)²)/(σ₀²−σₖ²)` — the `σ₀` ruins it. The
  sharp `σₖ/σₖ₋₁` constant is a genuine sin-Θ statement; there is no elementary triangle-inequality
  shortcut on the plain matrices. **The route doc's HIGH risk on L7c.3 stands.**
- **Cutting INSIDE a multiplicity block is FALSE.** With `σ₁ = σ₂` (cut at a non-gap), `‖Pₙ₊₁−Pₙ‖`
  reaches **1.0** (projector NOT Cauchy) and the RHS does not decay (`σₖ/σₖ₋₁ → 1`). Re-confirms
  "per DISTINCT exponent, never per index" as a hard correctness requirement, not style.

### G.2 The CHEAPEST correct route: exterior rank-1 Rayleigh-gap sin-Θ (NOT block Davis–Kahan)

VERDICT: **a full abstract Davis–Kahan / block sin-Θ theorem is NOT needed.** The exterior-power
machinery already committed (`compoundMatrix`, `prod_singularValues_eq_l2_opNorm_compound`,
`exteriorPower.map_comp` functoriality) collapses the block problem to a **rank-1 dominant-eigenvector
sin-Θ**, which has a fully ELEMENTARY (Parseval-only) proof. The reduction (numerically verified):

1. Top-`k` right-singular subspace of `Mₙ` ↔ (Plücker) the dominant eigenLINE of
   `Cₙ := (⋀^k Mₙ)ᵀ(⋀^k Mₙ) = ⋀^k Qₙ` on `⋀^k ℝᵈ ≅ ℝ^(d chok)`. Functoriality gives
   `⋀^k Mₙ₊₁ = (⋀^k B)(⋀^k Mₙ)`.
2. At a genuine gap `λ_{k-1} > λ_k`, the top two singular values of `⋀^k Mₙ` are
   `σ₀···σ_{k-1}` and `σ₀···σ_{k-2}σ_k`, ratio EXACTLY `σ_k/σ_{k-1}` (verified) — so the dominant
   eigenline of `Cₙ` is SIMPLE and gapped. A simple gapped top eigenline is the easiest sin-Θ case.
3. **Elementary rank-1 Rayleigh-gap lemma (the irreducible core, fully provable):** for self-adjoint
   `C` with top eigenvalue `μ₀`, second `≤ μ₁ < μ₀`, top unit eigenvector `v₀`, and ANY unit `v'`
   with `⟨C v', v'⟩ ≥ μ₀ − ε`, one has `sin²∠(v', v₀) ≤ ε/(μ₀ − μ₁)`. Proof = Pythagoras
   (`Submodule.norm_sq_eq_add_norm_sq_projection`, COMPILED) + the purely algebraic kernel
   `μ₀−ε ≤ μ₀c+b, b ≤ μ₁s, c+s=1 ⟹ s ≤ ε/(μ₀−μ₁)` (`nlinarith` after `c := 1−s`, COMPILED in
   `scratch_l7c3_sintheta.lean`). NO abstract Davis–Kahan, NO Riesz contour, NO operator-CFC
   continuity.
4. The Rayleigh deficit `ε = μ₀(Cₙ) − ⟨Cₙ v', v'⟩` for `v' =` dominant eigenvector of `Cₙ₊₁`
   is bounded by `(κ(⋀^k B)·σ_k/σ_{k-1})²` (verified, max ratio 0.18), via
   `⟨Cₙ v',v'⟩ = ‖⋀^k Mₙ v'‖² = ‖(⋀^kB)⁻¹ ⋀^k Mₙ₊₁ v'‖² ≥ ‖⋀^k Mₙ₊₁ v'‖²/‖⋀^kB‖² ≥ μ₀(Cₙ₊₁)/‖⋀^kB‖²`
   and `μ₀(Cₙ₊₁) ≥ μ₀(Cₙ)/‖(⋀^kB)⁻¹‖²`. Hence `sin∠ ≤ κ(⋀^kB)·σ_k/σ_{k-1}`.

Trade-off, stated honestly: the exterior route uses `κ(⋀^k B) = ‖⋀^kB‖‖(⋀^kB)⁻¹‖` (LOOSER than the
direct `κ(B)`), but `(1/n)log κ(⋀^kB)` is STILL tempered → 0 a.e. (it is `≤ k·log‖B‖ + k·log‖B⁻¹‖`
up to the committed `sigma_le_opNorm`/`prod_singularValues` sandwich), so summability is unaffected.
The WIN is that the irreducible analytic content shrinks from a block sin-Θ theorem (which Mathlib
lacks entirely and which would have to be built from scratch) to ONE scalar `nlinarith` kernel +
Pythagoras + the ALREADY-COMMITTED exterior bridge. This is strictly cheaper than building block
Davis–Kahan and is the recommended route.

Why NOT the direct (non-exterior) block route: it needs (i) the per-vector restricted-Rayleigh
bounds `v∈Eₙ ⟹ ‖Mₙv‖≥σₖ₋₁‖v‖` and `v∈Eₙ^⊥ ⟹ ‖Mₙv‖≤σₖ‖v‖` for the BLOCK (provable from the
eigenbasis but more bookkeeping), AND (ii) a genuine block sin-Θ assembly (multi-dimensional
principal angles). The exterior route replaces (ii) by the rank-1 lemma. Both need the eigenbasis
facts (COMPILED, `scratch_l7c3_rayleigh.lean`); only the exterior route avoids multi-dim sin-Θ.

Net L7c→L7d: **~7–11 sessions** (down from §E's 8–14), dominated now by L7c.3b+L7c.3c (the
exterior-deficit estimate + the Plücker subspace↔eigenline bridge), NOT by an abstract Davis–Kahan
theorem. The single-index exterior submultiplicativity `σⱼ(⋀^kB·X) ≤ ‖⋀^kB‖·σⱼ(X)` is a small new
lemma (Mathlib has only the product form `prod_singularValues_comp_le`; min-max is absent).

### G.5 What was COMPILED vs argued on paper (honest ledger)

| Probe | Claim | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `scratch_l7c3_index.lean` | (i) `Mₙ₊₁ = A(Tⁿx)·Mₙ` from committed cocycle; (ii) Cauchy ⇐ summable increments | **COMPILED exit 0** |

ARGUED ON PAPER + verified NUMERICALLY only (Python, not Lean):
- The increment bound `‖Pₙ₊₁−Pₙ‖ ≤ κ(B)σₖ/σₖ₋₁` with `C=1` (max ratio 0.52 over 50k+ trials).
- The exterior reduction: top-2 singular-value ratio of `⋀^k M` equals `σₖ/σₖ₋₁` (exact).
- The full chain `sin²∠ ≤ ε/g ≤ (κ(⋀^kB)·σₖ/σₖ₋₁)²` (max 0.18) and the rank-1 kernel `sin² ≤ ε/g`
  (tight, ratio 1.0).
- The `tan` form FAILS (518); cutting inside a multiplicity block FAILS (1.0). Both are correctness
  guards, not yet Lean-encoded.

These four numerically-verified inequalities are the L7c.3 work to formalize; the Lean *kernels* they
rest on are the four compiled probes above. No committed statement is contradicted.

### H.0 Verdict (TL;DR)

1. **L7c.3b does NOT need single-index σⱼ submultiplicativity.** §G.4 lists "needs single-index
   `σⱼ(⋀^kB·X) ≤ ‖⋀^kB‖·σⱼ(X)` (BUILD)" as a sub-task. This is an OVERSTATEMENT: the rank-1
   reduction (§G.2) only ever touches the TOP eigenvalue / operator norm of the compound, so the
   chain needs only PER-VECTOR operator-norm facts `‖P w‖ ≤ ‖P‖‖w‖`, `‖w‖ ≤ ‖P⁻¹‖‖P w‖`
   (probe `rank1`, all immediate from `ContinuousLinearMap.le_opNorm`). The min-max single-index
   lemma — which Mathlib genuinely lacks — is NOT on the critical path. (SURPRISE A.)
2. **L7c.3c back-transport is UNAVOIDABLE but the sharp principal-angle identity can be SIDESTEPPED.**
   The committed `L7_statement` fixes the limit object as a `d×d` matrix (`qpow → Λ`), so the `d×d`
   band projectors `bandProjector = cfc χ qpow` must be shown Cauchy; one cannot stay in `⋀^k`-space.
   But the SHARP `‖P_E − P_E'‖_op = sin θ_max` (needs principal angles — ABSENT from Mathlib) is NOT
   required: a **Frobenius route with a dimension-only constant 2k** works and avoids principal
   angles entirely (H.2, probes `plucker`+`frobenius`).
3. **L7c.1 is MED and fully probe-backed** (probe `eigproj`): the cfc-indicator equals the top-block
   eigenprojector via the explicit `IsHermitian.cfc = U·diag(χ∘eig)·Uᴴ` formula.

Net revised estimate L7c.3b → L7c.3c → L7d: **~5.5–8.5 sessions** (down from §G.4's 7–11), because
the σⱼ min-max build is removed (SURPRISE A) and the back-transport uses only soft trace algebra +
AM-GM + the committed det-Gram kernel, not a Davis–Kahan/principal-angle theory build.

### H.1 L7c.3b — the rank-1 exterior Rayleigh-deficit bound (exact statements)

The chain of §G.2 step 4, restated PRECISELY (no σⱼ index). With `Cₙ := compoundᵀ·compound` where
`compound := compoundMatrix k Mₙ` (so `Cₙ = ⋀^k Qₙ` on `⋀^k ℝᵈ`), and `v'` = top unit eigenvector
of `Cₙ₊₁`:

```
⟨Cₙ v', v'⟩ = ‖toEuclideanLin(compound k Mₙ) · v'‖²                       -- adjoint∘self Rayleigh
‖toEuclideanLin(compound k Mₙ) v'‖ ≥ ‖toEuclideanLin(compound k Mₙ₊₁) v'‖ / ‖⋀^kB‖
                                                                          -- ⋀^k Mₙ₊₁ = (⋀^kB)(⋀^k Mₙ)
μ₀(Cₙ₊₁) = ‖toEuclideanLin(compound k Mₙ₊₁) v'‖²                           -- v' is top eigvec
μ₀(Cₙ₊₁) ≥ μ₀(Cₙ) / ‖(⋀^kB)⁻¹‖²
⟹ μ₀(Cₙ) − ⟨Cₙ v', v'⟩ ≤ (1 − 1/(‖⋀^kB‖‖(⋀^kB)⁻¹‖)²)·μ₀(Cₙ)
                       ≤ (‖⋀^kB‖‖(⋀^kB)⁻¹‖)²·(σₖ/σₖ₋₁)²·μ₀(Cₙ)            -- §G.3b, ε form
```

**LOAD-BEARING facts (all COMPILED in `scratch_l7c3bc_rank1.lean`, exit 0):**
- `‖P w‖ ≤ ‖P‖·‖w‖` = `P.le_opNorm w` (CLM).
- `‖w‖ ≤ ‖Pinv‖·‖P w‖` from `Pinv ∘ P = id` (`congrArg` + `le_opNorm`).
- `⟨(adjoint P ∘ₗ P) w, w⟩ = ‖P w‖²` (`adjoint_inner_left` + `real_inner_self_eq_norm_sq`).
- `⟨C w, w⟩ ≤ ‖C‖·‖w‖²` for symmetric `C` (`real_inner_le_norm` + `le_opNorm`).

**NEW sub-lemma still to BUILD (small, LOW–MED):** the compound-multiplicativity
`toEuclideanLin (compoundMatrix k (B*M)) = toEuclideanLin (compoundMatrix k B) ∘ₗ toEuclideanLin (compoundMatrix k M)`
(Cauchy–Binet at the matrix level). DERIVABLE from committed `conjExteriorMap_eq_toEuclideanLin_compound`
+ `exteriorPower.map_comp` (the same telescoping used in `exteriorOpNorm_comp_le`). And
`μ₀(compoundᵀcompound) = ‖compound‖²` = `(∏_{i<k} σᵢ)²` from the committed
`prod_singularValues_eq_l2_opNorm_compound` + top-eigenvalue-of-AᵀA = op-norm².

Exact target signature (replaces the `sorry` in §G.3b `rayleigh_deficit_le`): unchanged in shape,
but the proof uses ONLY the rank-1 facts above + the new compound-mult lemma — NOT a σⱼ lemma.

> **SURPRISE A (corrects §G.4):** the row "needs single-index `σⱼ(⋀^kB·X) ≤ ‖⋀^kB‖σⱼ(X)` (BUILD)"
> is unnecessary. The min-max/Courant–Fischer single-index bound is genuinely ABSENT from Mathlib
> (confirmed: `Mathlib/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/SingularValues.lean` has only def, `_nonneg`,

> cost saving of this pass.

### H.2 L7c.3c — the Plücker back-transport: the Frobenius route (avoids principal angles)

The output of the rank-1 lemma (G.3a) is a sin-Θ bound on the dominant eigenLINE of `Cₙ = ⋀^k Qₙ`,
i.e. on the decomposable unit wedges `wₙ`, `wₙ₊₁` (Plücker images of o.n. frames of the top-k
eigenspaces `Eₙ`, `Eₙ₊₁`). The band projector `bandProjector A T χ n x` is (by L7c.1) the `d×d`
orthogonal projector `P_{Eₙ}`. We must bound `‖P_{Eₙ₊₁} − P_{Eₙ}‖` (L2 operator norm) by the wedge
sine. **Numerically verified, tight (ratio 1.0, 50k+ trials, gapped PD pairs, d≤6):**

```
‖P_E − P_E'‖_op²  ≤  1 − ⟨w_E, w_E'⟩²   ( = sin²∠_wedge )           (SHARP — needs principal angles)
```

The SHARP form needs `‖P−P'‖_op = sin θ_max` and `⟨w,w'⟩ = ∏cos θᵢ`, i.e. principal-angle theory,
which **Mathlib LACKS ENTIRELY** (grep: no `principalAngle`, no sin-Θ, no
`‖orthogonalProjection K − orthogonalProjection K'‖` identity, no Davis–Kahan). Building it is the
expensive path. **The CHEAPER substitute (this scout's recommendation):** a Frobenius bound with a
dimension-only constant, decomposing into pieces that need only trace algebra, AM-GM, and the
COMMITTED det-Gram kernel — no principal angles:

```
‖P − P'‖_op²  ≤  ‖P − P'‖_F²                                  -- self-adjoint: spectral radius ≤ HS
‖P − P'‖_F²   =  tr((P−P')²) = 2k − 2·tr(P·P')               -- P²=P, P'²=P', tr P = tr P' = (k:ℝ)
tr(P·P')      =  ‖UᵀV‖_F²  =  Σ cos²θᵢ                        -- P = UUᵀ, P' = VVᵀ; cyclic trace
k − ‖UᵀV‖_F²  ≤  k·(1 − det(UᵀV)²)                            -- AM-GM (k·∏cos² ≤ Σcos², det²≤1)
det(UᵀV)²     =  ⟨w_E, w_E'⟩²                                  -- COMMITTED hodgeForm_ιMulti det-Gram
⟹  ‖P − P'‖_op²  ≤  2k·(1 − ⟨w_E,w_E'⟩²)  =  2k·sin²∠_wedge
```

The constant `2k ≤ 2d` is a fixed dimension constant, so summability (L7c.4/L7c.5) is UNAFFECTED:
`sin∠_wedge ≤ κ(⋀^kB)·σₖ/σₖ₋₁` (G.3a∘G.3b) still decays geometrically a.e., and `√(2k)` is a
harmless multiplicative constant.

**LOAD-BEARING facts COMPILED:**
- `scratch_l7c3bc_plucker.lean` (exit 0): the decomposable-wedge inner product = cross-Gram
  determinant `det⟨v j, w i⟩` (via `exteriorPower.pairingDual_ιMulti_ιMulti` — the public path of
  the committed private `hodgeForm_ιMulti`); o.n. frame ⟹ self-Gram = `1`, det = 1 (unit wedge);
  the SCALAR back-transport closer `pd² ≤ 1−cmax², detc² ≤ cmax² ⟹ pd² ≤ 1−detc²` (`nlinarith`);
  the two-factor `(ab)² ≤ b²` core for `|cos| ≤ 1`.
- `scratch_l7c3bc_frobenius.lean` (exit 0): the trace identity `tr((P−Q)²) = 2k − 2 tr(PQ)` for
  self-adjoint idempotents of trace `k` (`trace_mul_comm` + `trace_sub/_add`, `abel` — matrices are
  NONCOMMUTATIVE so `ring` FAILS, use `abel` for the additive expansion); the AM-GM two-factor base
  `2−(t₀+t₁) ≤ 2(1−t₀t₁)`; the packaging `k·D ≤ S ⟹ k−S ≤ k(1−D)`; the sqrt closer
  `op² ≤ twok(1−d²), 0≤1−d² ⟹ op ≤ √twok·√(1−d²)`.

**Still to BUILD for L7c.3c (MED–HIGH but BOUNDED, no principal angles):**
- `‖M‖_op ≤ ‖M‖_F` for self-adjoint `M` on `Matrix (Fin d) (Fin d) ℝ` (L2 op-norm). Cleanest via the
  committed singular-value bridge: `‖M‖ = σ₀(toEuclideanLin M)` and `σ₀² ≤ Σσᵢ² = tr(MᵀM)`. There is
  norm-instance friction (L2-operator vs Frobenius `NormedAddCommGroup` instances on `Matrix`); the
  bridge sidesteps it by working through `toEuclideanLin`.
- the general-k AM-GM `k·∏cos² ≤ Σcos²` via `Real.geom_mean_le_arith_mean_weighted` (uniform weights
  `1/k`) + `∏cos² ≤ 1`. (FOUND in `Mathlib/Analysis/MeanInequalities.lean`.)
- the trace/Plücker glue: `tr(P_E P_E') = ‖UᵀV‖_F²` and `det(UᵀV) = ⟨w_E, w_E'⟩` tying the committed
  `compoundMatrix`/`hodgeForm_ιMulti` to the o.n. frames produced by `eigenvectorUnitary`.

> **SURPRISE B (sharpens §G):** the projector-difference ↔ wedge-sine identity (the genuinely novel
> "Plücker back-transport" infra) does NOT require the principal-angle machinery one would expect
> from a literal Davis–Kahan reading. Replacing the SHARP operator-norm identity by the LOOSER
> Frobenius bound with constant `2k` keeps summability and trades a (large) principal-angle theory
> build for soft trace algebra + AM-GM + the already-committed det-Gram kernel. This is the cheapest
> correct path and is what the implementation should take.

### H.3 L7c.1 — eigenprojector identification (exact statement + compiled load-bearing step)

For a threshold `c` strictly between the k-th and (k+1)-th sorted eigenvalues of `qpow A T n x`,
and `χ` continuous with `(spectrum ℝ (qpow…)).EqOn χ (indicator (Ioi c) 1)`, the band projector
equals the orthogonal projector onto the top-k eigenvectors:

```lean
theorem bandProjector_eq_orthProj_topBlock {A} {T} {χ : ℝ → ℝ} {c : ℝ} (n : ℕ) (x : X)
    (heq : (spectrum ℝ (qpow A T n x)).EqOn χ (Set.indicator (Set.Ioi c) 1))
    (hgap : … c strictly between eigenvalues k and k+1 …) :
    bandProjector A T χ n x
      = orthProjMatrix (span of eigenvectors of (gram A T n x) with eigenvalue > c²ⁿ)   -- d×d projector
```

**Load-bearing step COMPILED in `scratch_l7c3bc_eigproj.lean` (exit 0):**
- `cfc χ A = hA.cfc χ` (`cfc_eq`) and `hA.cfc χ = U · diag(ofReal∘χ∘eig) · Uᴴ`
  (`Matrix.IsHermitian.cfc` + `Unitary.conjStarAlgAut_apply`).
- {0,1}-valued χ∘eig ⟹ `diag(ofReal∘χ∘eig)` idempotent (`diagonal_mul_diagonal`); conjugation by the
  unitary `U` (via `Unitary.coe_star_mul_self : star U * U = 1`) preserves idempotence ⟹ `cfc χ A` is
  a genuine orthogonal projector.
- `cfc_congr heq` replaces continuous χ by the exact indicator on the (finite) spectrum.
- `indicator (Ioi c) 1 (eig i) = 1` iff `c < eig i`, else `0` (`Set.indicator_of_mem`/`_notMem`) —
  the diagonal selects exactly the top block.

The remaining work (MED, ~1 sess) is identifying the conjugated diagonal projector with
`orthProjMatrix (top-block span)` — reuse the committed `Measurable.lean` `orthProjMatrix` pattern
(a self-adjoint idempotent equals the orthogonal projection onto its range) — plus pinning that
`eigenvalues(qpow) > c ↔ eigenvalues(gram) > c²ⁿ` via the committed `eigenvalues₀_qpow_eq`.

  dimension-uniform); `k·∏tᵢ ≤ Σtᵢ` for tᵢ∈[0,1] (0 violation); top-2 singular-ratio of `⋀^k M`
  equals `σₖ/σₖ₋₁`.
- The Frobenius bound is NOT controlled by `1−⟨w,w'⟩²` with a CONSTANT < `k` (ratio grows with k —
  the `2k` factor is necessary, not removable).

### H.7 Flags on §G claims

- §G.4 row L7c.3b "needs single-index `σⱼ(⋀^kB·X) ≤ ‖⋀^kB‖σⱼ(X)` (BUILD)" — **CORRECTED**: not
  needed (H.1, SURPRISE A). Removed from the ladder.
- §G.4 row L7c.3c "the subspace↔eigenline (Plücker) bridge is new infra" — **REFINED**: the bridge
  is real, but it is the Frobenius `2k`-constant route (trace + AM-GM + det-Gram), NOT a
  principal-angle/Davis–Kahan build (H.2, SURPRISE B). The sharp `sin θ_max` identity is sidestepped.
- §G.2 step 4 chain — **CONFIRMED** Lean-expressible exactly as written with the committed compound
  API + the rank-1 facts (H.1, probe `rank1`); one new compound-mult lemma (L7c.3b.0) is required.
- No committed statement is contradicted; `sin_sq_le_rayleigh_deficit_div_gap`, `eigenvalues₀_qpow_eq`,
  `prod_singularValues_eq_l2_opNorm_compound`, `L7_statement` all remain sound.

### I.0 RESOLVED — UNCERTAINTY 1: top-2 eigenvalues of `Cₙ = (⋀^k Mₙ)ᵀ(⋀^k Mₙ) = ⋀^k Qₙ`

The committed `exteriorOpNorm_hodge_eq_prod_singularValues` proof DIAGONALIZES `conjExteriorMap`
internally: its `hortho` shows the standard-basis images of the SVD-basis conjugated exterior map
are PAIRWISE ORTHOGONAL with weights `c i = ∏_{a∈S_i} σ_a²`, `S_i` over the k-subsets of `Fin nE`.
These weights ARE the eigenvalues of `Cₙ = adjoint∘self` (a self-adjoint operator, diagonal in that
o.n. basis). Hence, CONFIRMED:

- **eigenvalues of `Cₙ` = `{ (∏_{a∈S} σ_a)² : |S| = k }`** (the SVD diagonalization).
- **`μ₀(Cₙ) = (∏_{i<k} σᵢ)² = ‖compoundMatrix k Mₙ‖²`** — top prefix set `{0,…,k-1}`, maximal by the
  committed `prod_le_prod_top`; and `= ‖compound‖²` via `prod_singularValues_eq_l2_opNorm_compound`
  (top eigenvalue of `AᵀA = ‖A‖²`). Probe `top2eig` (1a/1c/1e).
- **`μ₁(Cₙ) = (σ₀···σ_{k-2}·σ_k)² = (∏_{i<k-1}σᵢ²)·σ_k²`** — the SECOND set swaps `σ_{k-1}→σ_k`;
  it is `≤ μ₀` exactly when `σ_k ≤ σ_{k-1}` (genuine gap). Probe `top2eig` (1b/1c).
- **GAP `μ₀ − μ₁ = (∏_{i<k-1}σᵢ²)·(σ_{k-1}² − σ_k²)`, `> 0 ⟺ σ_{k-1} > σ_k`** (and all prefix
  factors `> 0`). Probe `top2eig` (1d). At a genuine exponent gap the dominant eigenLINE of `Cₙ` is
  SIMPLE, so `sin_sq_le_rayleigh_deficit_div_gap` applies with `v₀` the decomposable wedge of the
  top-k right-singular vectors.

**The `hμ₁` ceiling (cleanest Lean route).** `hμ₁ : ∀ w ⊥ v₀, ⟪Cₙ w, w⟫ ≤ μ₁‖w‖²`. In the SVD
o.n. eigenbasis of `Cₙ`, write `w = Σ aᵢ eᵢ`; orthogonality to `v₀ = e_{i₀}` (the top index) means
`a_{i₀}=0`. Then `⟪Cₙ w,w⟫ = Σ cᵢ aᵢ²` and every remaining weight `cᵢ ≤ μ₁` (the top is dropped),
so `⟪Cₙ w,w⟫ ≤ μ₁ Σ aᵢ² = μ₁‖w‖²`. The PURE scalar kernel (weighted sum, weights `≤ μ₁` off the
dropped support) is COMPILED in probe `top2eig` (1f). This is strictly softer than re-proving the
diagonalization: it consumes the committed `hortho` orthogonality directly. **No new abstract
spectral theorem is needed for the ceiling.**

### I.1 RESOLVED — UNCERTAINTY 2: projector↔wedge glue (the Frobenius back-transport)

For orthonormal frames `U,V : Matrix (Fin d) (Fin k) ℝ` (columns = o.n. bases of `Eₙ,Eₙ₊₁`),
`P = U·Uᵀ`, `P' = V·Vᵀ`:

- **`tr(P·P') = ‖UᵀV‖_F²`** — cyclic trace `tr(UUᵀVVᵀ) = tr((UᵀV)(UᵀV)ᵀ)` then
  `tr(AAᵀ)=Σ A²`. COMPILED probe `glue` (G1/G1'). Matrices NONCOMMUTATIVE: used `Matrix.mul_assoc`
  + `trace_mul_comm`, not `ring`.
- **`det(UᵀV) = ⟪w_{Eₙ}, w_{Eₙ₊₁}⟫`** (det-Gram = decomposable-wedge inner product) — via the
  committed `hodgeForm_ιMulti`'s public path `exteriorPower.pairingDual_ιMulti_ιMulti`. COMPILED
  probe `glue` (G2).
- **`k·∏cos²θᵢ ≤ Σcos²θᵢ`** — ELEMENTARY: each `cos²≤1 ⟹ ∏ ≤ each factor ⟹ k·∏ = Σ_j(∏) ≤ Σ_j cos²_j`.
  NO `geom_mean` needed (contra §H.6's "AM-GM `geom_mean_le_arith_mean_weighted`" suggestion — the
  uniform-weight geom-mean is AVOIDABLE; the one-line product-≤-factor argument suffices). COMPILED
  probe `glue` (G3 general-Finset + G3-range). **This simplifies the §H.2 build (no MeanInequalities
  dependency).**

Chaining (the committed `singularValues_zero_sq_le_sum` gives `‖P−P'‖_op² ≤ ‖P−P'‖_F²` through the
σ-bridge; the trace identity `tr((P−P')²)=2k−2tr(PP')` is the committed-style `frobenius` probe):
`‖P−P'‖_op² ≤ ‖P−P'‖_F² = 2k − 2tr(PP') = 2k − 2‖UᵀV‖_F² ≤ 2k(1−det(UᵀV)²) = 2k(1−⟪w,w'⟫²)
= 2k·sin²∠_wedge`.

**Band projector gives the frame `U` DIRECTLY.** `bandProjector A T χ n x = cfc χ (qpow)
= U·diag(χ∘eig)·Uᴴ` by committed `cfc_eq_eigenvectorUnitary_conj`. For the 0/1 top-block indicator,
`diag` selects the top-k columns of the eigenvector unitary `U`, so `bandProjector = U_top·U_topᵀ`
with `U_top` = those columns — i.e. `P = U Uᵀ` is IMMEDIATE (the diag-selector·unitary collapses to
the column-frame outer product; idempotence under unitary conjugation COMPILED probe `glue` (G4)).
So no separate "extract the frame from the projector" lemma is needed.

### I.3 §G/§H correction — SURPRISE C (the relative-gap amplifier)

§G.2 step 4 / §H.1 claim the deficit→sin chain "collapses to `sin²∠ ≤ C·κ(⋀^kB)²·(σ_k/σ_{k-1})²`"
with `C` absolute. The LITERAL algebra (probe `chain` C1-literal, COMPILED) gives, with `a=σ_{k-1}²`,
`b=σ_k²`, `pre=∏_{i<k-1}σ²`, `ε ≤ κ²·(b/a)·μ₀`, `μ₀=pre·a`, `μ₀−μ₁=pre·(a−b)`:

```
sin²∠ ≤ ε/(μ₀−μ₁) ≤ κ²·b/(a−b) = κ²·σ_k²/(σ_{k-1}² − σ_k²).
```

To rewrite this as `C·κ²·(σ_k/σ_{k-1})² = C·κ²·b/a` one needs `C ≥ a/(a−b) = σ_{k-1}²/(σ_{k-1}²−σ_k²)`
— **a relative-gap AMPLIFIER that is NOT a fixed/absolute constant** (it blows up as the gap closes,
`b↑a`). So §G/§H's "`C` absolute" is, strictly, FALSE for a SINGLE generic `n`.

**Why it is harmless (and the fix).** Along the orbit, `(σ_k/σ_{k-1})² = b/a → 0` because
`(1/n)log(σ_k/σ_{k-1}) → λ_k − λ_{k-1} < 0` (committed `tendsto_log_singularValue`, distinct
exponents). Hence EVENTUALLY `b ≤ a/2`, where the amplifier `a/(a−b) ≤ 2`, giving the clean
`sin²∠ ≤ 2·κ²·(σ_k/σ_{k-1})²` (probe `chain` C1-amplifier, COMPILED). Since L7c.4 only needs EVENTUAL
geometric decay of the increments (`Summable` is a tail property), the displayed clean RHS in
`norm_bandProjector_succ_sub_le` is correct from some `n₀(x)` onward — exactly the regime
summability lives in. **Fix to the doc: state `norm_bandProjector_succ_sub_le` either (a) with the
honest RHS `κ²·σ_k²/(σ_{k-1}²−σ_k²)` (always true), or (b) with the clean `2·κ²·(σ_k/σ_{k-1})²` under
the EVENTUAL hypothesis `σ_k ≤ σ_{k-1}/√2`. Route (a) is cleaner to prove; route (b) feeds L7c.4
directly.** Either way summability is unaffected; the crux estimate stands. The probe `chain` also
recompiles the rest of the chain: C2 (sin²→op `√(2k)`), C3/C3′ (`κ(⋀^kB) ≤ ‖B‖^k‖B⁻¹‖^k`, log/n→0),
C4/C4-const (the `λ_k−λ_{k-1}<0` log-limit), C5 (`ρⁿ` ⟹ Summable).

statement-shape fix to `norm_bandProjector_succ_sub_le`, not new analytic content.

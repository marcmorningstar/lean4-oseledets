# The Arsenin–Kunugui measurable-projection theorem (top-down skeleton)

This module targets the strictly-stronger **everywhere-Borel** (not merely a.e.) form of the
singular ("issue #6") measurable-projection gap. It states the **Arsenin–Kunugui theorem** — a
Borel set `B ⊆ X × Y` (`X`, `Y` Polish) whose every section `B_x` is **σ-compact** (`K_σ`) has a
**measurable** (Borel) projection `Prod.fst '' B` — decomposes its proof into named leaves
following Srivastava, *A Course on Borel Sets*, §5.12 (cf. Kechris, *Classical Descriptive Set
Theory*, Thm 35.46; see also 28.8), proves sorry-free everything Mathlib currently supports, and
isolates the two genuine descriptive-set-theory walls as precisely-documented BLOCKED leaves.

It is the everywhere-Borel counterpart of the **a.e.** route already discharged sorry-free in
`Frontier.Issue6.MeasurableProjection` and migrated to `Oseledets.Singular`: there the projection is
merely *analytic*, hence (Choquet capacitability,
`MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.nullMeasurableSet`) *universally measurable* — `NullMeasurableSet` for
every s-finite measure, which suffices for the a.e. theorem. The present file targets genuine
`MeasurableSet`-ness of the projection, which the analytic route cannot give: a Borel projection is
analytic but **not** in general Borel (the classical Lebesgue/Souslin error). The
σ-compact-section hypothesis is exactly what rescues Borel-ness — this is the Arsenin–Kunugui
phenomenon.

## The classical proof structure (Srivastava §5.12)

`Theorem 5.12.1` (Arsenin–Kunugui) reduces, in three named steps, to a single deep
descriptive-set-theory input:

1. **`5.12.3` (compact-section decomposition).** A Borel set `A ⊆ X × Y` with σ-compact sections is
   a *countable union* `A = ⋃ₙ Bₙ` of Borel sets `Bₙ` with **compact** sections. This is the crux
   and is `5.12.2` applied to `B = Aᶜ`.

2. **Projection of a Borel set with compact sections is Borel** (Srivastava `4.7.11`; Kechris
   `28.8`). Then `Prod.fst '' A = ⋃ₙ Prod.fst '' Bₙ` is a countable union of Borel sets, hence
   Borel.

3. **`5.12.2` (Saint Raymond's σ-compact separation theorem).** For analytic `A, B ⊆ X × Y` with,
   for every `x`, a σ-compact `K` with `A_x ⊆ K ⊆ (B_x)ᶜ`, there is a sequence of Borel sets `Bₙ`
   with compact sections covering `A` and disjoint from `B`. This is the irreducible
   descriptive-set-theory wall.

## What is proved sorry-free here, and what is BLOCKED

### Sorry-free, reusable topological wiring (the proper-map heart of step 2)

The genuinely true and reusable content is the **proper-map** characterisation of when a projection
is well-behaved:

* `Frontier.image_fst_eq_range_restrict`: `Prod.fst '' S` is the range of the restricted projection
  `(fun p : S => p.1.1)`.
* `Frontier.isClosed_image_fst_of_isProperMap_restrict`: if that restricted projection is a
  **proper map**, then `Prod.fst '' S` is **closed** (`IsProperMap.isClosed_range`).
* `Frontier.measurableSet_image_fst_of_isProperMap_restrict`: hence (over any `BorelSpace X`) the
  projection is `MeasurableSet`.
* `Frontier.isProperMap_fst_restrict_of_isClosed_compactSpace`: for a **closed** `S` with the whole
  fibre space `Y` **compact**, the restricted projection is proper — the one fully sorry-free
  *instance* of properness (e.g. `Y` a closed bounded box). This is `Prod.fst` (proper when `Y` is
  compact) restricted to the closed `S` via `IsProperMap.restrict`.

### A correction that is recorded (a naive lemma is FALSE)

A tempting shortcut — *"`S` closed with each section `S_x` compact ⟹ `Prod.fst '' S` is closed"* —
is **false** without properness/compactness of `Y`. Counterexample (`docstring` of
`not_isClosed_image_fst_of_isClosed_isCompact_sections`): `S = {(x, 1/x) : x ≠ 0} ⊆ ℝ × ℝ` is
closed (it is the graph of `1/·`, escaping to `∞` near `0`), every section is a singleton or empty
(compact), yet `Prod.fst '' S = ℝ \ {0}` is **open, not closed**. The classical `4.7.11` correctly
claims only a **Borel** (in fact `F_σ`) projection, *not* a closed one — exactly why the proper-map
hypothesis (or σ-compactness) is load-bearing and the projection lemma below stays BLOCKED rather
than collapsing to this false topological shortcut.

### The two BLOCKED descriptive-set-theory walls

* `Frontier.measurableSet_image_fst_of_isCompact_sections` (BLOCKED — Srivastava `4.7.11`, Kechris
  `28.8`): the projection of a *Borel* set with *compact* sections is Borel. Only the proper case is
  sorry-free above; the Borel→Borel case is a Lusin–Souslin-scale result (a Borel set with compact
  sections is a countable union of *closed*-section pieces via the same hyperspace derivative
  machinery, then a proper-map argument applies fibrewise). No Mathlib API exists for it.

* `Frontier.exists_borel_compactSection_cover` (BLOCKED — Srivastava `5.12.3` ⇐ Saint Raymond
  `5.12.2`): a Borel set with σ-compact sections is a countable union of Borel compact-section sets.
  This needs the full descriptive-set-theory apparatus absent from Mathlib: the **Effros Borel
  structure** on the hyperspace `F(Y)` of closed sets, **derivatives** `D : F(Y) → F(Y)` and their
  transfinite ranks `|A|_D`, the **`Π¹₁`-boundedness theorem** (`sup{|A|_D : A ∈ 𝒜} < ω₁` for
  analytic `𝒜 ⊆ Ω_D`), and `WO`/`LO` codings of countable orders. None exist in Mathlib (no
  hyperspace Borel structure, no coanalytic ranks, no boundedness theorem). This is the principal
  research-scale wall.

Granting these two leaves, the assembly down to the issue-#6 target
`Frontier.measurableInfDist_of_measurableGraph_AK` (the everywhere-Borel `MeasurableInfDist`
discharge) is proved sorry-free here, exactly mirroring the classical `5.12.1 ⇐ 5.12.3 + 4.7.11`
reduction.

section FalseShortcut

/-- **A naive shortcut is FALSE (recorded as an existence of a counterexample).** It is *not* true
that a closed `S ⊆ X × Y` with every section `S_x` compact has closed projection `Prod.fst '' S`.
Witness in `ℝ × ℝ`: `S = {(x, y) | x ≠ 0 ∧ x * y = 1}` (the graph of `y = 1/x`). It is closed (it
escapes to infinity as `x → 0`, so has no limit points off itself), each section `S_x` is a
singleton (`x ≠ 0`) or empty (`x = 0`) — hence compact — yet `Prod.fst '' S = {x | x ≠ 0}` is open,
not closed. This is why `measurableSet_image_fst_of_isCompact_sections` stays BLOCKED rather than
collapsing to a (false) topological one-liner: the classical `4.7.11` gives only a **Borel** (here
`F_σ`) projection. We state the witness existence; the full topological verification of closedness
of `S` is standard (graph of a continuous proper-to-`∞` map) and not needed downstream. -/

then is each piece's projection seen to be Borel. No Mathlib API exists for any of this (no Effros

apparatus that Mathlib lacks entirely:

* the **Effros Borel structure** on the hyperspace `F(Y)` of closed subsets of `Y` (a standard Borel
  space) — *not in Mathlib*;
* **derivatives** `D : F(Y) → F(Y)` (e.g. `D_𝒦` for the family `𝒦` of compact sets) and their
  transfinite iterates `Dᵅ`, with rank `|A|_D = least α, Dᵅ⁺¹(A) = Dᵅ(A)` — *not in Mathlib*;

# The derivative (tangent) cocycle of a smooth self-map of a manifold

This is the **manifold generalisation** of `Oseledets/Smooth/DerivativeCocycle.lean`
(the `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)` case). For a `C¹` self-map `T : M → M` of a finite-dimensional
manifold `M` modelled on a *real inner-product* model space `E` (so the tangent spaces inherit an
inner product and `M` is morally Riemannian with the model metric), the family of manifold
derivatives `x ↦ mfderiv I I T x` is a linear cocycle over `T`: by the manifold chain rule
(`mfderiv_comp`) the derivative of the `n`-th iterate `T^[n]` factors as a product of derivatives
along the orbit.

There are three layers, mirroring the task brief:

1. **The bundle cocycle.** `bundleDerivativeCocycle I T x := mfderiv I I T x`, recorded as an
   endomorphism `E →L[ℝ] E` of the model fibre. The *native* type of `mfderiv I I T x` is
   `TangentSpace I x →L[ℝ] TangentSpace I (T x)`, but in Mathlib `TangentSpace I x` is, *by
   definition*, the model space `E` for every `x` (an abuse of definitional equality that
   "definitionally trivialises" the tangent bundle over a chart-free type synonym). Giving the
   generator the homogeneous endomorphism type `E →L[ℝ] E` (by `rfl`) is what makes the family a
   genuine linear cocycle — composable, with a `Monoid` for `IsUnit`, and a non-dependent codomain
   for `Measurable`.

2. **The chain-rule cocycle identity** (`bundleDerivativeCocycle_iterate_succ`,
   `chainRule_cocycle_manifold`): the product of derivatives along the orbit equals
   `mfderiv I I (T^[n]) x`, proved by induction from `mfderiv_comp` exactly as in the Euclidean
   file (`Oseledets.chainRule_cocycle`).

3. **The matrix framing** (`derivativeCocycleManifold`): transport the endomorphism of `E` to a
   matrix `Matrix (Fin d) (Fin d) ℝ` through a *fixed* linear isometry
   `E ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)` (`frameEquiv`, built from `stdOrthonormalBasis ℝ E`) and the
   star-algebra equivalence `Matrix.toEuclideanCLM`. This is the "measurable trivialisation /
   orthonormal frame field" of the task — and here it is even *globally constant* because the model
   fibre is fixed: the conjugating frame does not depend on `x`. The matrix cocycle then feeds the
   matrix MET `Oseledets.oseledets_filtration` verbatim.

## The wall

The single genuine obstruction is **measurability of `x ↦ mfderiv I I T x`** as a map
`M → (E →L[ℝ] E)` (equivalently, of the framed generator `derivativeCocycleManifold I T`). Mathlib
has *no* measurability theory for the manifold derivative: `mfderiv` is defined chart-locally as
`if MDifferentiableAt … then fderivWithin (writtenInExtChartAt …) … else 0`, and there is no global
lemma `Measurable (fun x => mfderiv I I T x)` (the analogue of `measurable_fderiv` used in the
Euclidean file), nor any `MeasurableSpace` instance produced from a `ChartedSpace` structure.
Supplying it is a Mathlib-scale task (gluing the chart-local `fderivWithin`-measurability across a
countable measurable cover by chart domains, after equipping `M` with its Borel σ-algebra). It is
isolated here as the hypothesis `hAmeas` of `oseledets_filtration_derivativeCocycleManifold` and as
the single `sorry` in `measurable_bundleDerivativeCocycle`.

## Main definitions

* `Frontier.Issue2.frameEquiv` — the fixed framing `E ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)`.
* `Frontier.Issue2.bundleDerivativeCocycle` — the bundle generator `x ↦ mfderiv I I T x`.
* `Frontier.Issue2.derivativeCocycleManifold` — the matrix generator (framed bundle generator).

## Main results

* `Frontier.Issue2.bundleDerivativeCocycle_iterate_succ` — bundle chain-rule cocycle identity
  (one-step recursion; **sorry-free**).
* `Frontier.Issue2.chainRule_cocycle_manifold` — the matrix cocycle represents the framed
  `mfderiv I I (T^[n]) x` (**sorry-free**).
* `Frontier.Issue2.det_derivativeCocycleManifold_ne_zero` — nonvanishing determinant from
  invertibility of each bundle generator (**sorry-free**).
* `Frontier.Issue2.measurable_bundleDerivativeCocycle` — measurability of the bundle generator
  (**the wall**; one documented `sorry`).
* `Frontier.Issue2.oseledets_filtration_derivativeCocycleManifold` — the Oseledets filtration for
  the derivative cocycle of an ergodic `C¹` self-map of `M`, taking the framed-generator
  measurability as a hypothesis (so this statement is itself **sorry-free**).

into an endomorphism of `EuclideanSpace`, hence (via `Matrix.toEuclideanCLM`) into a matrix.

Crucially this framing is **globally constant** — it does not depend on the base point `x` — because
Mathlib models every tangent space `TangentSpace I x` on the *same* fixed space `E`. This is exactly
the measurable bundle trivialisation required by the manifold MET, here in its simplest (constant)

Measurability of the manifold derivative `x ↦ mfderiv I I T x : E →L[ℝ] E` for a `C¹` self-map `T`
of a **boundaryless** manifold, equipped with its Borel σ-algebra.

This is the single irreducible measurability obligation behind the manifold MET, isolated as a
`sorry` with the sharpest honest hypotheses identified by the feasibility analysis
(`docs/research/frontier/issue2/FEASIBILITY-2026-06-22.md`, Strategy α/γ):

* `[I.Boundaryless]` ⇒ `range I = univ`, so chart-locally
  `mfderiv I I T x = fderiv ℝ (writtenInExtChartAt I I x T) (extChartAt I x x)` (no `fderivWithin`
  over `range I`; Mathlib has **no** `measurable_fderivWithin` over a proper closed set, only over
  `univ` via the unconditional `measurable_fderiv`);
* `ContMDiff I I 1 T` (C¹) ⇒ `ContMDiffAt.mfderiv_const` makes the fixed-base in-coordinates
  representative `inTangentCoordinates I I id T (mfderiv I I T) x₀` *continuous* on a chart
  neighbourhood of each `x₀`;
* `[SigmaCompactSpace M] [SecondCountableTopology H]` ⇒ a countable atlas, so the chart-local
  measurable representatives glue (via `measurable_of_measurable_on_countable_cover`) into a global
  measurable map.

The remaining gap is the *recovery* step: passing from the (continuous, hence measurable) fixed-base
representative `inTangentCoordinates … x₀` back to `mfderiv I I T x` itself requires conjugating by
two `tangentCoordChange` factors whose **chart index moves with the base point** — a
moving-trivialization-index continuity that Mathlib packages only *inside* `inTangentCoordinates`
(via the smooth-tangent-bundle machinery), never as an isolable factor. Closing it is the
~250-400-line chart-algebra telescoping flagged at ~70% odds in the report. It is recorded here as a
single sharp, fully-typed `sorry` — strictly stronger hypotheses than the original opaque leaf, and
faithful to the literature (Filip §2.2.2; Arnold, *RDS*, Ch. 4). -/

/-- **Oseledets multiplicative ergodic theorem for the derivative cocycle of a manifold map.**

Let `T` be an ergodic measure-preserving `MDifferentiable` self-map of a finite-dimensional manifold
`M` (modelled on an inner-product space `E`), with everywhere-nonsingular tangent cocycle and
integrable log-derivative data `log⁺‖Dₓ T‖, log⁺‖(Dₓ T)⁻¹‖ ∈ L¹(μ)`. Then there is an
`A`-equivariant Lyapunov filtration of the (framed) tangent space with the exact growth
`(1/n) log‖D(T^[n]) v‖ → λᵢ` along each stratum, for `A := derivativeCocycleManifold I T`.

The integrability hypotheses are stated for the matrix generator; by `norm_derivativeCocycleManifold`
these are exactly the genuine `log⁺‖mfderiv‖` (and inverse) conditions. The first conjunct records
that the cocycle is the genuine tangent cocycle: each factor
`cocycle (derivativeCocycleManifold I T) T n x` equals `frameAlg E (mfderiv I I (T^[n]) x)`.

The measurability hypothesis `hAmeas` is exactly what `measurable_derivativeCocycleManifold` would
supply once the manifold-derivative measurability wall (see there) is discharged; taking it as a
hypothesis here isolates that single Mathlib-scale gap and keeps **this** theorem `sorry`-free. -/
